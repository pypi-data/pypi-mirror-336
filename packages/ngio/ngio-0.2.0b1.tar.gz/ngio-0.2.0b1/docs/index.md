# Welcome to NGIO

NGIO is a Python library to streamline OME-Zarr image analysis workflows.

**Main Goals:**

- Abstract object base API for handling OME-Zarr files
- Powefull iterators for processing data using common access patterns
- Tight integration with [Fractal's Table Fractal](https://fractal-analytics-platform.github.io/fractal-tasks-core/tables/)
- Validate OME-Zarr files

To get started, check out the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) guide.

## ðŸš§ Ngio is Under active Development ðŸš§

### Roadmap

| Feature | Status | ETA | Description |
|---------|--------|-----|-------------|
| Metadata Handling | âœ… | | Read, Write, Validate OME-Zarr Metadata (0.4 supported, 0.5 ready) |
| OME-Zarr Validation | âœ… | | Validate OME-Zarr files for compliance with the OME-Zarr Specification + Compliance between Metadata and Data |
| Base Image Handling | âœ… | | Load data from OME-Zarr files, retrieve basic metadata, and write data |
| ROI Handling | âœ… | | Common ROI models |
| Label Handling | âœ… | Mid-September | Based on Image Handling |
| Table Validation | âœ… | Mid-September | Validate Table fractal V1 + Compliance between Metadata and Data |
| Table Handling | âœ… | Mid-September | Read, Write ROI, Features, and Masked Tables |
| Basic Iterators | Ongoing | End-September | Read and Write Iterators for common access patterns |
| Base Documentation | âœ… | End-September | API Documentation and Examples |
| Beta Ready Testing | âœ… | End-September | Beta Testing; Library is ready for testing, but the API is not stable |
