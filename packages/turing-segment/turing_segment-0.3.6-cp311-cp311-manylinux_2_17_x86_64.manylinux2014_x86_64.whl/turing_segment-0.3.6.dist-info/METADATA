# Turing segment
This is the internal repository for developing turing segment, for public facing one, check
`turing_segment` repository and the docs directory.


## Releasing Turing Segment

Turing segment has a dual repository structure:
- `modeling`: private repository, where the actual code lives.
```
https://github.com/bioturing-org/modeling
```
- `turing_segment`: public repository, where issues from customers will be collected.
```
- https://github.com/bioturing-org/turing_segment
```

To release a new version of turing segment:
1. Build the wheels on `modeling`.
    - Tag the release and push them to github.
    - Wait for CI/CD to build.

2. Tag the `turing_segment` repository.
    - Make sure to use the same tag as `modeling`.
    - Push the tag to github.

3. Download the encrypted wheels and push it to the `turing_segment` release page.
    - Use `scripts/release.py` in `turing_segment` to download and push the wheels.
    ```
    python3 scripts/release.py

    ```
    - Make sure to use the right tag and credentials.
    - The wheel will be downloaded to the `assets` folder.

4. Push the encrypted wheel to pypi.
    - Use `twine` to push to pipy.
    ```
    python3 -m twine upload assets/* --verbose

    ```
    - Contact Mr. Tam or Mr. Hoa for credentials.


### TODO
This is not a fully automated CI because of complications when setting up the CI/CD
on github. Resolve this issuse.
