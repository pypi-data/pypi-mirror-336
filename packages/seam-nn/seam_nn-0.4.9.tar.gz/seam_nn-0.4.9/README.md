**SEAM** (**S**ystematic **E**xplanation of **A**ttribution-based for **M**echanisms) is a Python suite to use meta-explanations to interpret sequence-based deep learning models for regulatory genomics data. For installation instructions, tutorials, and documentation, please refer to the SEAM website, https://seam-nn.readthedocs.io/. For an extended discussion of this approach and its applications, please refer to our paper:

---

## Installation:

With [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html) sourced, create a new environment via the command line:

```bash
conda create --name seam
```

Next, activate this environment via `conda activate seam`, and install the following packages:

```bash
pip install seam-nn
```

Finally, when you are done using the environment, always exit via `conda deactivate`.


### Notes

SEAM has been tested on Mac and Linux operating systems. Typical installation time on a normal computer is less than 1 minute.

If you have any issues installing SEAM, please see:
- https://seam-nn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
- https://github.com/evanseitz/seam-nn/issues

For issues installing SQUID, the package used for sequence generation and inference, please see:
- https://squid-nn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
- https://github.com/evanseitz/squid-nn/issues

Older DNNs may require inference via Tensorflow 1.x or related packages in conflict with SEAM defaults. Users will need to run SEAM piecewise within separate environments:
1. Tensorflow 1.x environment for generating *in silico* sequence-function-mechanism dataset
2. Tensorflow 2.x environment for applying SEAM to explain *in silico* sequence-function-mechanism dataset

## Usage:
SEAM provides a simple interface that takes as input a sequence-based deep-learning model (e.g., a DNN), which is used as an oracle to generate an *in silico* sequence-function-mechanism dataset representing a localized region of sequence space. SEAM uses a meta-explanation framework to interpret the *in silico* sequence-function-mechanism dataset, deciphering the determinants of mechanistic variation in regulatory sequences.

### Examples

**Google Colab examples** for applying SEAM on previously-published deep learning models are available at the following links:

- [Figure 2. Local library with hierarchical clustering | DeepSTARR](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HOM_ysa4HIh_ZoYzLwa4jZu4evyRntF7?usp=sharing)

Expected run time for the "Figure 2. Local library with hierarchical clustering | DeepSTARR" demo (above) is **~3.6 minutes** using Google Colab T4 GPU.

**Python script examples** are provided in the `examples/` folder for locally running SEAM and exporting outputs to file. Additional dependencies for these examples may be required and outlined at the top of each script. Examples include:

- To be done.

<!-- As well, the [seam-manuscript](https://github.com/evanseitz/seam-manuscript) repository contains examples to reproduce results in the manuscript, including the application of SQUID on other DNNs such as ChromBPNet and directly to experimental datasets -->
