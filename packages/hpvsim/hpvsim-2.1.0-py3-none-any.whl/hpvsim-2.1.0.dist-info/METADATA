Human papillomavirus simulator (HPVsim)

This repository contains the code for the Starsim suite's human papillomavirus simulator, HPVsim. HPVsim is a flexible agent-based model that can be parameterized with country-specific vital dynamics, structured sexual networks, co-transmitting HPV genotypes, B- and T-cell mediated immunity, and high-resolution disease natural history. HPVsim is designed with a user-first lens: it is implemented in pure Python, has built-in tools for simulating commonly-used interventions, has been extensively tested and documented, and runs in a matter of seconds to minutes on a laptop. Useful complexity was not sacrificed: the platform is flexible, allowing bespoke scenario modeling.

HPVsim is currently under active development.


Installation
------------

The easiest way to install is simply via pip: ``pip install hpvsim``. Alternatively, you can clone this repository, then run ``pip install -e .`` (don't forget the dot!) in this folder to install ``hpvsim`` and its dependencies. This will make ``hpvsim`` available on the Python path. The first time HPVsim is imported, it will automatically download the required data files (~30 MB).


Usage and documentation
-----------------------

Documentation is available at https://docs.hpvsim.org. Additional usage examples are available in the ``tests`` folder.


Contributing
------------

If you wish to contribute, please follow the Starsim style guide at: https://github.com/amath-idm/styleguide. See the code of conduct readme for more information.
