# first non-comment line must be the short description:
Utilities library with several more or less independent components

This library is mainly intended for myself, so I can access it from
anywhere. But anyone else is welcome to have a look. Documentation
is still lacking, I know, but that shall change. Testing is better.

The full documentation (what already exists of it) for this version
is at
<https://git.w21.org/ni/jpylib/-/blob/v$__package_version$/doc/jpylib.md>
