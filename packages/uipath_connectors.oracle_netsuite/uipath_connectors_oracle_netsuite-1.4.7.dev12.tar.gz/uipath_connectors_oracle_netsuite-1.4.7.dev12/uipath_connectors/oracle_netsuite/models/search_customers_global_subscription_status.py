                subscription statuses:    * Confirmed Opt-In - When an email recipient has indicated that they want to receive
                your campaign and bulk merge email, they are assigned this subscription status. Only a recipient can set his or
                her subscription status to Confirmed Opt-In.    * Soft Opt-In - Recipients with this status can receive opt-in
                messages that enable them to confirm whether or not they want to receive your email campaigns as well as bulk
                email.      You can set a recipientâ€™s status to Soft Opt-In manually or through a mass update.    * Soft Opt-Out
                - Recipients with this status cannot receive campaign or bulk email messages but can receive opt-in messages.
                You can change this subscription status to Soft Opt-In manually or through a mass update.    * Confirmed Opt-Out
                - Only the recipient can set their subscription status to Confirmed Opt-Out.      Recipients with this status
                cannot receive email campaigns, bulk email, or opt-in messages. Recipients with this status can only opt in
                again through the Customer Center or by clicking the link in an email message they have received prior to opting
                out.
