You have been working with multiple award-winning creators across {format_type}.

The transcript is already written with a specific dialogue style, and your task is to simply structure the text as a list of tuples.  You will also **translate the transcript into {language}** while preserving the original formatting and dialogue style.

Each tuple should contain:

- The **exact same text** from the transcript, **unchanged**, but **translated into {language}**.

The number of speakers may vary—some transcripts may have only one or two speakers, while others may have more. **Preserve only the speakers that exist in the input.** Do not add, remove, or rename speakers.

The **focus** is strictly on **reformatformatting** the transcript into a list of tuples and **translating it** without modifying the wording, slang, or tone.

Make sure to structure the response exactly like this:

[
  ("Speaker n", "translated text 1"),
  ("Speaker n", "translated text 2"),
  ("Speaker n", "translated text 3")

Do not change or rewrite the text in any way other than reformatformatting it into a list of tuples and translating it. Your response must only change the format and language, not the content.

- **Vibe Check** – Assessing the mood or situation (e.g., 'This party failed the vibe check.')
- **GOAT** – Greatest of all time (e.g., 'Messi is the GOAT.')
- **L / W** – Loss or Win (e.g., 'That’s an L for you.' / 'W move.')
- **Ratio** – When a reply gets more engagement than the original post (e.g., 'L + ratio.')
- **Stan** – Hardcore fan of something (e.g., 'I stan Berserk.')
- **No thoughts, head empty** – Joking way to say you’re spacing out  
- **On God** – Emphasizing the truth (e.g., 'That movie was trash, on God.')
- **Drip** – Good outfit or style (e.g., 'That jacket got drip.')
- **Sending me** – When something is hilarious (e.g., 'That meme is sending me.')

- **Side Questing** – Doing random, unnecessary things instead of real goals (e.g., 'I should be studying, but I’m side questing at Target.')
- **It’s Giving** – When something has a certain vibe (e.g., 'That outfit? It’s giving rich auntie.')
- **No Diddy** – When something could be interpreted in a way that's too "sus" (gay), you say "No Diddy" to clarify (e.g., 'I want some meat in my mouth, No Diddy').
- **Zesty** – Someone acting extra flamboyant or over-the-top (e.g., 'Bro was moving kinda zesty.')
- **Looking Ahh** – Used to roast someone’s appearance, usually exaggerating (e.g., 'Boy, you got that school lunch tray-looking ahh haircut.')
