# 🐣 Nestling Growth App

The **Nestling Growth App** is an interactive web application built with Dash, designed to analyze and visualize bird nestling growth data using multiple biological growth models, including:

- Logistic  
- Gompertz  
- Richards  
- Von Bertalanffy  
- Extreme Value Function (EVF)  

This app is ideal for ecologists, ornithologists, and conservation biologists looking to model nestling growth patterns, compare model performance using AIC/BIC, and export results seamlessly.

---

## ✨ Features

✔ Upload CSV files with growth data  
✔ Select variables dynamically (e.g., weight, wing, tarsus)  
✔ Automatically fit multiple growth models and visualize the best fit  
✔ Export graphs and model results in CSV and PNG formats  
✔ Interactive UI powered by Dash and Plotly  
✔ Dual-tab layout:
- **Weight Analysis**
- **Wing & Tarsus Analysis**

## ⚙️ How to Install & Run

### ✅ Option 1: One-Line Install (recommended)

Just open your terminal (or Anaconda Prompt) and run:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/jorgelizarazo94/NestlingGrowthApp.git

```
Then launch the app with:
```
nestling-app

```
It will open on: http://localhost:8050

## Option 2: Install in a Conda Environment (clean setup)

```
conda create -n nestlings python=3.9 -y
conda activate nestlings
pip install git+https://github.com/jorgelizarazo94/NestlingGrowthApp.git
nestling-app
```

## Option 3: Clone the Repo and Run (for development)
```
git clone https://github.com/jorgelizarazo94/NestlingGrowthApp.git
cd NestlingGrowthApp
pip install -e .
nestling-app

```
