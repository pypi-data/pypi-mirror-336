# Git Batch Commit

Git Batch Commit is an advanced Python-based command-line tool designed to automate and simplify batch staging, 
committing, and pushing files in Git repositories. Ideal for developers working with a large number of files, 
it allows users to control the number of files per commit, reducing performance issues and making version 
control more efficient.

## Features:
- **Batch Staging & Committing** – Stage and commit files in user-defined batch sizes.
- **Interactive CLI** – Users can choose the number of files to commit at each step.
- **Automated Push** – Commits are automatically pushed to the remote repository.
- **Error Handling** – Prevents common Git errors, such as missing staged files.
- **Custom Commit Messages** – Users can provide their own commit messages or use generated ones.
- **Cross-Platform** – Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
