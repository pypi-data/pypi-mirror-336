QIDLearningLib is the first comprehensive Python library designed for automated quasi-identifier (QID) recognition and evaluation in tabular datasets. It integrates metrics from causality, data privacy, and data utility to provide a holistic assessment of potential QIDs, enabling systematic identification and mitigation of privacy risks in data sharing and analysis.  

The implemented metrics can be used flexibly within the provided optimization algorithms‚Äîincluding evolutionary algorithms, simulated annealing, and greedy search‚Äîto automatically select QIDs that balance data privacy and utility. This ensures that users can tailor the selection process based on their specific needs, optimizing privacy protection while preserving data usability.


## Key Features

- Integration of metrics from causality, data privacy, and data utility domains designed for QID selection
- Support for multiple optimization algorithms including evolutionary algorithms, simulated annealing, and greedy search for automated QID selection
- Redundancy analysis to identify the most relevant, non-overlapping metrics
- Graphical and testing tools for metrics' enhanced interpretability
- Evaluation metrics to assess the performance of QID selection systems against ground-truth
- Compliance with regulatory frameworks like GDPR

## Installation

bash
pip install QIDLearningLib


## Quick Usage Example

python
import pandas as pd
from QIDLearningLib.optimizer.ea import EvolutionaryAlgorithm
from QIDLearningLib.metrics.performance import recall, specificity, accuracy

# Load your dataset
df = pd.read_csv("your_dataset.csv")

# Define metrics for optimization
metrics = [
    {"name": "Distinction", "weight": 0.25, "maximize": True},
    {"name": "Separation", "weight": 0.25, "maximize": True},
    {"name": "k-Anonymity", "weight": -0.4, "maximize": True},
    {"name": "Delta Distinction", "weight": 0.2, "maximize": True},
    {"name": "Delta Separation", "weight": 0.2, "maximize": True},
    {"name": "Attribute Length Penalty", "weight": -1, "maximize": True}
]

# Configure and run the evolutionary algorithm
ea = EvolutionaryAlgorithm(df, metrics, population_size=50, generations=30)
best_individual, best_fitness, history = ea.run()

# Retrieve selected QIDs
selected_attributes = df.columns[best_individual == 1]

# Evaluate performance against ground truth (if available)
ground_truth_qids = {"Age", "Gender", "Zipcode"}  # Example ground truth
recall_score = recall(selected_attributes, ground_truth_qids)
specificity_score = specificity(selected_attributes, ground_truth_qids)
accuracy_score = accuracy(selected_attributes, ground_truth_qids)
