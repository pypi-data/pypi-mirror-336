## 🔑 **Important: API Key Setup**

If you're using scripts that interact with OpenAI's ChatGPT, you **must** set your API key before running them. Otherwise, the `get_response_function` will not work.

Set your API key using the following command:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

Make sure to replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.
