def SenGoode(T, C_f):
    """
    Calculate soil water real electrical conductivity using the Sen and Goode model and return

    Based on the model proposed by Sen and Goode (1992 a, b) [1][2], this function estimates 
    the oil water real electrical conductivity given the soil temperature and 
    salinity of the bulk pore fluid.

    Parameters
    ----------
    T : array_like
        Soil bulk temperature [K]
    C_f : array_like
        Soil (NaCl) salinity of the bulk pore fluid [mol/L].

    Returns
    -------
    water_ec : array_like
        Soil water real electrical conductivity [S/m].

    Notes
    -----
    The function uses specific coefficients based on the Sen and Goode model to 
    compute the electrical conductivity of soil water, taking into account the 
    temperature and salinity effects.
