### SQL Injection - Detection and Prevention System

SQLIDPS is a tool designed to detect and prevent SQL injection attacks in web applications. SQL injection is a common attack vector that allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL code on a database, potentially leading to data breaches and other security issues. This project aims to provide a robust solution for identifying and mitigating such vulnerabilities.

### Flow Chart
The data flow in SQLIDPS illustrates how user inputs are processed to detect and prevent SQL injection attacks.  
Below is a detailed visualization of the flow:
