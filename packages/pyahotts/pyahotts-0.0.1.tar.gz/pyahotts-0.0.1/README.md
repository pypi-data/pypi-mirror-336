It includes linguistic processing and built voices for the languages aforementioned. Its acoustic
engine is based on hts_engine and it uses a high quality vocoder called
AhoCoder. Developed by Aholab Signal Processing Laboratory, at the Bilbao
School of Engineering (University of the Basque Country).

## Compile

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TigreGotico/pyAhoTTS
cd pyAhoTTS
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. 
make
```

## Usage

from pyahotts import AhoTTS

# for x86 you don't need to pass lib_path
# libhtts_x86.so is bundled with the package
tts = AhoTTS(
    lib_path="/home/miro/PycharmProjects/AhoTTS/libhtts_aarch64.so"
)

audio_bytes = tts.get_tts("Kaixo Mundua!", lang="eu", wav_path="output_eu.wav")

if audio_bytes:
    print(f"Generated {len(audio_bytes)} bytes of audio.")

audio_bytes = tts.get_tts("Hola Mundo", lang="es", wav_path="output_es.wav")

if audio_bytes:
    print(f"Generated {len(audio_bytes)} bytes of audio.")
