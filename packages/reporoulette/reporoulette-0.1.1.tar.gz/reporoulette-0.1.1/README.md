## 🚀 Installation

```bash
# Using pip
pip install reporoulette

# From source
git clone https://github.com/gojiplus/reporoulette.git
cd reporoulette
pip install -e .
```

## 📖 Sampling Methods

RepoRoulette provides three distinct methods for random GitHub repository sampling:

### 1. 🎯 ID-Based Sampling

Uses GitHub's sequential repository ID system to generate truly random samples by probing random IDs from the valid ID range.

```python
from reporoulette import IDSampler

# Initialize the sampler
sampler = IDSampler(token="your_github_token")

# Get 50 random repositories
repos = sampler.sample(n_samples=50)

# Print basic stats
print(f"Success rate: {sampler.success_rate:.2f}%")
print(f"Samples collected: {len(repos)}")
```

**Advantages:**
- Simple

**Limitations:**
- Lower hit rate (many IDs are invalid)
- No control over repository characteristics

### 2. ⏱️ Temporal Sampling

Randomly selects time points (date/hour combinations) within a specified range and then retrieves repositories updated during those periods.

```python
from reporoulette import TemporalSampler
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Define a date range (last 3 months)
end_date = datetime.now()
start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=90)

# Initialize the sampler
sampler = TemporalSampler(
    token="your_github_token",
    start_date=start_date,
    end_date=end_date
)

# Get 100 random repositories
repos = sampler.sample(n_samples=100)

# Get repositories with specific characteristics
filtered_repos = sampler.sample(
    n_samples=50,
    min_stars=10,
    languages=["python", "javascript"]
)
```

**Advantages:**
- Higher hit rate than ID-based sampling
- Can filter by repository characteristics
- Allows for stratified sampling by time periods

### 3. 🔍 BigQuery Sampling

Leverages Google BigQuery's GitHub dataset for high-volume, efficient sampling. We hit the hour files than the much larger day files (which can really run up a bill).

```python
from reporoulette import BigQuerySampler

# Initialize the sampler (requires GCP credentials)
sampler = BigQuerySampler(
    credentials_path="path/to/credentials.json"
)

# Sample 1,000 repositories created in the last year
repos = sampler.sample(
    n_samples=1000,
    created_after="2023-01-01",
    sample_by="created_at"
)

# Sample repositories with multiple criteria
specialty_repos = sampler.sample(
    n_samples=500,
    min_stars=100,
    min_forks=50,
    languages=["rust", "go"],
    has_license=True
)
```

**Advantages:**
- Handles large sample sizes efficiently
- Powerful filtering and stratification options
- Not limited by GitHub API rate limits
- Access to historical data

**Limitations:**
- Could be expensive
- Requires Google Cloud Platform account and billing
- Dataset may have a slight delay (typically 24-48 hours)

## 📊 Example Use Cases

- **Academic Research**: Study coding practices across different languages and communities
- **Learning Resources**: Discover diverse code examples for education
- **Data Science**: Build datasets for machine learning models about code patterns
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify emerging technologies and practices
- **Security Research**: Find vulnerability patterns across repository types
