OTF2
----
The Open Trace Format 2 (OTF2) is a highly scalable, memory efficient
event trace data format plus support library.

## Building

To build OTF2 you usually just need to do

  ./configure
  make
  make install

Please have a look at INSTALL for further configure and build options.

After make install you will find html and pdf documentation as well as
usage examples under $(prefix)/share/doc/otf2.

## Testing

Configure with `--enable-backend-test-runs` then run

  ./configure --enable-backend-test-runs
  make check
  make install
  make installcheck

Note: To keep the test output for subsequent inspection, set `KEEP_TEST_OUTPUT=1`
in the environment. But it prevents building a package with `make dist`.

## Citing

Please refer to the Open Trace Format 2 by citing the overview article
_[Open Trace Format 2: The Next Generation of Scalable Trace Formats and Support Libraries](https://doi.org/10.3233/978-1-61499-041-3-481)_

Version-specific DOIs of the software can be found on
[OTF2's Zenodo page](https://zenodo.org/record/1240851).
