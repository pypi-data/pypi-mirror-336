    """
    Backs up the running configuration of a Palo Alto Networks device to a specified file.

    This function exports the current running configuration from the given device, which can be either a Firewall or
    Panorama, and writes it to a local file in XML format. The backup operation is an essential precautionary measure
    prior to performing system updates, modifications, or troubleshooting, providing a reliable rollback point.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target_device : Union[Firewall, Panorama]
        The device instance from which to back up the configuration. This must be an initialized object of type
        Firewall or Panorama with active connectivity to the device.
    hostname : str
        A string representing the hostname or IP address of the target device, used primarily for logging purposes.
    file_path : str
        The full path to the file where the configuration backup will be saved. If the directory path does not exist,
        it will be created.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Returns True if the backup is successful, indicating the configuration has been safely written to the specified
        file. Returns False if any part of the backup process fails, such as issues with retrieving the configuration or
        writing to the file.

    Raises
    ------
    Exception
        Raises a generic Exception if an unexpected error occurs during the backup process, including issues with
        retrieving the configuration from the device or writing to the specified file.

    Examples
    --------
    Backing up the configuration of a firewall:
        >>> firewall = Firewall(hostname='192.168.1.1', api_username='admin', api_password='adminpassword')
        >>> backup_configuration(firewall, '192.168.1.1', '/path/to/firewall_backup.xml')
        True  # Assuming the backup was successful

    Backing up the configuration of a Panorama appliance:
        >>> panorama = Panorama(hostname='panorama.example.com', api_username='admin', api_password='adminpassword')
        >>> backup_configuration(panorama, 'panorama.example.com', '/path/to/panorama_backup.xml')
        True  # Assuming the backup was successful

    Notes
    -----
    - The backed-up configuration is saved in XML format, mirroring the exact state of the device's configuration at
    the time of the backup.
    - It is recommended to periodically back up configurations, especially before significant system changes, to ensure
    a recovery point is available.
    - While this function provides an essential capability in device management workflows, users should handle the
    backup files securely and maintain appropriate file permissions to protect sensitive configuration data.

    Sets up the logging infrastructure for the application, specifying the minimum severity level of messages to log,
    character encoding for log files, and file logging details such as path and maximum size. The function initializes
    logging to both the console and a rotating file, ensuring that log messages are both displayed in real-time and
    archived for future analysis. The rotating file handler helps manage disk space by limiting the log file size and
    archiving older logs. This setup is crucial for monitoring application behavior, troubleshooting issues, and
    maintaining an audit trail of operations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    level : str
        The minimum severity level of log messages to record. Valid levels are 'DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARNING', 'ERROR',
        and 'CRITICAL', in order of increasing severity.
    encoding : str, optional
        The character encoding for the log files. Defaults to 'utf-8', accommodating a wide range of characters and symbols.
    log_file_path : str, optional
        The path to the log file where messages will be stored. Defaults to 'logs/upgrade.log'.
    log_max_size : int, optional
        The maximum size of the log file in bytes before it is rotated. Defaults to 10 MB (10 * 1024 * 1024 bytes).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the specified logging level is invalid, ensuring that log messages are captured at appropriate severity levels.

    Examples
    --------
    Basic logging configuration with default settings:
        >>> configure_logging('INFO')
        # Configures logging to capture messages of level INFO and above, using default encoding and file settings.

    Advanced logging configuration with custom settings:

    Evaluates if an upgrade is necessary for the specified device to reach the desired PAN-OS version.

    This function assesses the current PAN-OS version of the target device against the specified target version. If the
    current version is older than the target version, it indicates that an upgrade is required. Conversely, if the current
    version is the same as or more recent than the target version, the function logs that no upgrade is needed, and it
    terminates the script to prevent unnecessary operations. This evaluation helps in maintaining the device's firmware
    up-to-date or avoiding inadvertent downgrades.

    Parameters
    ----------
    current_version : str
        The device's current PAN-OS version to be evaluated for an upgrade.
    hostname : str
        The hostname or IP address of the target device. It is used for logging purposes to clearly identify the device
        in log messages.
    target_major : int
        The major version component of the desired PAN-OS version (e.g., '10' in PAN-OS 10.0.0).
    target_minor : int
        The minor version component of the desired PAN-OS version (e.g., '0' in PAN-OS 10.0.0).
    target_maintenance : Union[int, str]
        The maintenance or hotfix version component of the desired PAN-OS version. It can be an integer for standard
        maintenance releases or a string for hotfixes (e.g., '1-h1' in PAN-OS 10.0.1-h1).

    Raises
    ------
    SystemExit
        If the function determines that an upgrade is not required or if a downgrade is attempted, it will log the
        appropriate message and terminate the script to prevent further execution.

    Examples
    --------
    Checking if a firewall requires an upgrade to PAN-OS 9.1.0:

    Notes
    -----
    - The current and target versions are parsed and compared in a structured manner to accurately determine the need for
    an upgrade.
    - This function is crucial for maintaining device firmware integrity by ensuring that only necessary upgrades are

    Ensures the existence of the directory path for a given file path, creating it if necessary.

    This function is crucial for file operations, particularly when writing to files, as it guarantees that the directory path exists prior to file creation or modification. It parses the provided file path to isolate the directory path and, if this directory does not exist, it creates it along with any required intermediate directories. This proactive approach prevents errors related to non-existent directories during file operations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file_path : str
        The complete file path for which the existence of the directory structure is to be ensured. The function identifies the directory path component of this file path and focuses on verifying and potentially creating it.

def flatten_xml_to_dict(element: ET.Element) -> dict:
    """
    Converts an XML ElementTree element into a nested dictionary, maintaining its hierarchical structure.

    This function iterates over the provided XML ElementTree element, converting each element and its children into a nested dictionary format. Element tags serve as dictionary keys, and the element text content, if present, is assigned as the value. For elements with child elements, a new nested dictionary is created to represent the hierarchy. When an element tag is repeated within the same level, these elements are aggregated into a list under a single dictionary key, preserving the structure and multiplicity of the XML data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    element : ET.Element
        The root or any sub-element of an XML tree that is to be converted into a dictionary.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary representation of the input XML element, where each key corresponds to an element tag, and each value is either the text content of the element, a nested dictionary (for child elements), or a list of dictionaries (for repeated child elements).

    Examples
    --------
    Converting a simple XML element:
        >>> xml_string = '<status>active</status>'
        >>> element = ET.fromstring(xml_string)
        >>> flatten_xml_to_dict(element)

        {'configuration': {'item': [{'key': '1', '_text': 'Value1'}, {'key': '2', '_text': 'Value2'}]}}

    Notes
    -----
    - This function is designed to work with XML structures that are naturally representable as a nested dictionary. It may not be suitable for XML with complex attributes or mixed content.
    - Attributes of XML elements are converted into dictionary keys with a leading underscore ('_') to differentiate them from child elements.
    - If the XML structure includes elements with repeated tags at the same level, these are stored in a list under the same key to preserve the structure within the dictionary format.
    - The function simplifies XML data handling by converting it into a more accessible and manipulable Python dictionary format.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the XML structure includes elements that cannot be directly mapped to a dictionary format without ambiguity or loss of information, a ValueError is raised to indicate potential data integrity issues.

    Notes
    -----
    - Utilizes the `tabulate` library to display a structured and readable table for device selection.
    - Supports various input formats for device selection, such as individual numbers, ranges (e.g., '2-4'), or a comma-separated list, offering flexibility in selection methodology.
    - Gracefully handles invalid selections with prompts for correction, ensuring a user-friendly selection process.
