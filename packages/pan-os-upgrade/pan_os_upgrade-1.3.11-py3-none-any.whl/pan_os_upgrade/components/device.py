    Initializes the environment for interacting with a Palo Alto Networks device, including directory setup and logging configuration.

    This function consolidates essential preparatory steps required before performing operations on a Palo Alto Networks device. It ensures the creation of necessary directories for organized data storage and logs, and sets up logging with a configurable verbosity level.

    Parameters
    ----------
    settings_file : LazySettings
        The LazySettings object containing configurations loaded from the settings file.
    settings_file_path : Path
        The filesystem path to the settings.yaml file, which contains custom configuration settings.

    Example
    -------
    Initializing the environment for a device:
        >>> common_setup(
                settings_file=Dynaconf(settings_files=[str(SETTINGS_FILE_PATH)]),
                settings_file_path=SETTINGS_FILE_PATH,
            )
        # Ensures necessary directories exist, and logging is configured.

    Notes
    -----
    - Directory setup is performed only once; existing directories are not modified.
    - Logging configuration affects the entire application's logging behavior; the log level can be overridden by `settings.yaml` if `SETTINGS_FILE_PATH` is detected in the function.

    The ability to override default settings with `settings.yaml` is supported for the log level configuration in this function if `SETTINGS_FILE_PATH` is utilized within `configure_logging`.

    Establishes a secure API connection to a Palo Alto Networks device, such as a Firewall or Panorama.

    This function attempts to connect to the specified hostname using API credentials, differentiating between Firewall and Panorama based on the response. Successful connection results in the creation of a PanDevice object, which serves as the foundation for subsequent API interactions with the device. Comprehensive error handling is included to address common connection issues, providing actionable feedback for resolution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hostname : str
        The network address or DNS name of the Palo Alto Networks device to connect to.
    username : str
        The API username for authenticating with the device.
    password : str
        The API password for authenticating with the device.

    Returns
    -------
    PanDevice
        A PanDevice object representing the connected device, which may be a Firewall or Panorama instance, ready for further API operations.

    Raises
    ------
    SystemExit
        Exits the script with an error message if connection attempts fail, which may occur due to incorrect credentials, network connectivity issues, or an unreachable device.

    Examples
    --------
    Establishing a connection to a Firewall:
        >>> firewall = connect_to_host('firewall.example.com', 'admin', 'password')
        # Returns a Firewall object if connection is successful.

    Establishing a connection to Panorama:
        >>> panorama = connect_to_host('panorama.example.com', 'admin', 'password')

    Notes
    -----
    - Initiating a connection to a device is a prerequisite for performing any operational or configuration tasks via the API.
    - The function's error handling provides clear diagnostics, aiding in troubleshooting connection issues.
    - Configuration settings for the connection, such as timeout periods and retry attempts, can be customized through the `settings.yaml` file, if `settings_file_path` is utilized within the function.
    - A successful device connection is critical for the function to return; otherwise, it may raise exceptions based on connection issues.

It is designed to assist in diagnostics, inventory management, operational monitoring, and checking the HA status by providing a comprehensive overview of the firewall's current operational state, configuration, and HA status.

    Parameters
    ----------
    firewall : Firewall
        The Firewall instance from which to fetch system information and HA status. This object must be initialized with the necessary authentication credentials and network details to enable API communication with the firewall.

    Fetches a list of firewalls managed by a specified Panorama appliance, with optional filtering based on firewall attributes.

    This function queries a Panorama appliance to retrieve details about the firewalls it manages. It supports filtering the results based on various firewall attributes such as model, serial number, or software version, among others. The function leverages Panorama's API to gather firewall data, which it then encapsulates into Firewall objects for convenient handling within Python. This capability is particularly beneficial for tasks that require interaction with a specific subset of firewalls, such as performing batch configurations, updates, or generating reports.

    Parameters
    ----------
    panorama : Panorama
        The Panorama instance from which to retrieve managed firewalls. This object must be initialized with proper authentication credentials.

    Returns
    -------
    list[Firewall]
        A list of Firewall objects, each representing a firewall managed by Panorama that matches the specified filtering criteria. Returns all managed firewalls if no filters are applied.

    Examples
    --------
    Retrieving all firewalls managed by Panorama:
        >>> firewalls = get_firewalls_from_panorama(panorama_instance)

    Notes
    -----
    - This function is crucial for scripts aimed at performing operations across multiple firewalls managed by a Panorama appliance, enabling targeted actions based on specific criteria.
    - Utilizes dynamic filtering to provide flexibility in selecting firewalls based on various attributes, enhancing the script's utility in complex environments.
    - Default filter settings can be overridden by a `settings.yaml` file if `settings_file_path` is used within the script, providing a mechanism for customization and default configuration.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    - The function itself does not explicitly raise exceptions but relies on the proper handling of Panorama API responses and potential network or authentication issues by the Panorama class methods.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target_device : Union[Firewall, Panorama]
        The device from which HA information is to be retrieved. This must be an initialized instance of either
        a Firewall or Panorama, with connectivity established to the device.

    Initiates a reboot on a specified device (Firewall or Panorama) and verifies it boots up with the desired PAN-OS version.
    This function is critical in completing the upgrade process, ensuring that the device is running the expected software version

    after the reboot.

    The process sends a reboot command to the device, waits for it to go offline and come back online, and then checks if the rebooted
    PAN-OS version matches the target version. For devices in an HA setup, additional steps are taken to verify the HA status and
    synchronization between the HA peers post-reboot.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target_device : Union[Firewall, Panorama]
        The device object representing either a Firewall or Panorama, with necessary connectivity details.
    hostname : str
        The hostname or IP address of the target device, used for identification in logs and status messages.
    target_version : str

    ha_details : Optional[dict], default None
        A dictionary containing High Availability configuration details, if applicable, to ensure HA coherence post-reboot.
    initial_sleep_duration : int, default 60
        The initial waiting period (in seconds) after issuing the reboot command, before starting to check the device's status.

    Raises
    ------
    SystemExit
        If the device fails to reboot to the specified PAN-OS version after a set number of retries, or if HA synchronization

    --------
    Rebooting a device post-upgrade and verifying its PAN-OS version:
