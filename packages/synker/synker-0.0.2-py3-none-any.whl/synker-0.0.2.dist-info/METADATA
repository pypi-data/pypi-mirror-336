# üì¶ synker

**synker** is a Python package designed for generating synthetic datasets based on real data using kernel density estimation (KDE) methods. It supports bandwidth selection (Scott's and Silverman's rules), 2D KDE, synthetic data generation, and KL divergence evaluation between real and synthetic datasets.

---

## üöÄ Features
- **Bandwidth Estimation**: Scott's Rule and Silverman's Rule
- **2D Kernel Density Estimation**
- **Synthetic Data Generation** based on KDE
- **KL Divergence Calculation** for model evaluation
- Modular design for easy extension and usage

---

## üß† Installation
Clone the repository and install the package locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhaselib/synker
cd synker
pip install .
```

---

## üóÇ Example Usage
```python
import numpy as np
from synker.scott import Scott
from synker.silverman import Silverman
from synker.kde import KDE_2D
from synker.kl_div import KL_div
from synker.synthetic import Synthetic


# Generate sample data
np.random.seed(42)
data = np.random.weibull(a=2, size=(100, 2))

# Test Scott's bandwidth
hx = Scott(data[:, 0])
hy = Scott(data[:, 1])
print(f"Scott's Bandwidth hx: {hx}, hy: {hy}")

# Test Silverman's bandwidth
hx_sil = Silverman(data[:, 0])
hy_sil = Silverman(data[:, 1])
print(f"Silverman's Bandwidth hx: {hx_sil}, hy: {hy_sil}")

# Test KDE
grid_x = np.linspace(data[:, 0].min(), data[:, 0].max(), 100)
grid_y = np.linspace(data[:, 1].min(), data[:, 1].max(), 100)
density = KDE_2D(data[:, 0], data[:, 1], grid_x, grid_y, hx, hy)
print(f"KDE Density Shape: {density.shape}")

# Test Synthetic
Synth_data = Synthetic(data, hx=hx, hy=hy, grid_x=grid_x, grid_y=grid_y, n_samples=100)
print(f"Synthetic Data Shape: {Synth_data.shape}")

# Test KL Divergence 
kl = KL_div(data, Synth_data, hx, hy)
print(f"KL Divergence (self): {kl}")
```

---

## ‚úÖ Testing
We provide a `test_synker.py` file to test core functionalities like Scott's Rule, KDE, synthetic sampling, and KL divergence:

### Run Tests:
```bash
python -m unittest test_synker.py
```

### Tests Include:
- Scott and Silverman bandwidth estimation
- 2D KDE output validation
- Synthetic data shape and bounds
- Non-negative KL divergence check
