# A File Content Search and Management System with OCR 

## Project Description
My system will provide the ability of file content searching and management capabilities with OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for images. 

It allows the user to:
- Scan and index files across directories or a specific directory 
- Extract the content from both regular files (like pdf, txt, docx, etc..) and images using OCR
- Store the content, files name, location
- Enables content-based search without requiring filenames
- Provides fast and accurate search results by using Meilisearch as a search engine (after files are scanned)

## Technical Architecture
- Language: Python 3.10+
- OCR Engine: Tesseract (might change this later)
- Search Engine: Meilisearch for the content text search

## Key Features
- Support (text, images, PDFs, docx)
- OCR for images to extract its content
- Content indexing and search
- Metadata extraction and management
