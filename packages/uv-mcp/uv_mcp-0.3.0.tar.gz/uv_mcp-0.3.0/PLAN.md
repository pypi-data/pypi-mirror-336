# Implementation Plan for uv-mcp

## Core Components

### 1. uv Integration Layer
- [ ] Create wrapper around uv CLI commands
- [ ] Implement error handling for uv command execution
- [ ] Parse and standardize uv command outputs

### 2. MCP Resources

#### Package Resources
- [ ] Implement `packages://installed` resource
  - Returns list of all installed packages with versions
- [ ] Implement `packages://outdated` resource
  - Compare installed vs latest available versions

#### Requirements Resources
- [ ] Implement `requirements://{path}` resource
  - Parse requirements files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml)
  - Extract version constraints
  - Highlight conflicts or issues

### 3. MCP Tools

#### Environment Tools
- [ ] Implement `list_packages()` tool
  - List all installed packages with versions
- [ ] Implement `check_package_installed(package_name)` tool
  - Check if specific package is installed
  - Return version and installation path if found
- [ ] Implement `compare_environments(env1, env2)` tool
  - Compare packages between two environments
  - Identify version differences
  - Report missing packages

#### Package Management Tools
- [ ] Implement `get_package_info(package_name)` tool
  - Get detailed package information
  - Include dependencies, compatible versions
- [ ] Implement `install_package(package_name, version=None)` tool
  - Install specified package using uv
  - Handle version constraints
- [ ] Implement `uninstall_package(package_name)` tool
  - Remove package from environment

#### Virtual Environment Tools
- [ ] Implement `create_virtualenv(path, packages=None)` tool
  - Create new virtual environment
  - Optionally install specified packages
- [ ] Implement `activate_virtualenv(path)` tool
  - Switch to specified virtual environment

### 4. Server Implementation
- [ ] Set up MCP server using Python SDK
- [ ] Register all resources and tools
- [ ] Implement configuration handling
- [ ] Add authentication mechanism (if needed)
- [ ] Set up logging

### 5. Testing
- [ ] Create test fixtures with sample environments
- [ ] Unit tests for all tools and resources
- [ ] Integration tests with actual uv commands
- [ ] Test with various Python versions

### 6. Packaging and Distribution
- [ ] Set up pyproject.toml with dependencies
  - Required: mcp, uv
- [ ] Create entry points for CLI commands
- [ ] Configure packaging for PyPI distribution

## Development Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
1. uv integration layer
2. Basic resources (installed packages, package info)
3. Basic tools (list packages, check installation)

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
1. Environment comparison tools
2. Requirement file parsing
3. Dependency analysis

### Phase 3: Management Capabilities
1. Package installation/uninstallation
2. Virtual environment creation
3. Environment activation

## Technical Considerations

### uv Integration
- Use subprocess to call uv CLI commands
- Parse JSON output when available
- Fall back to text parsing when needed

### Error Handling
- Create custom exceptions for different error types
- Provide meaningful error messages for LLMs
- Implement graceful degradation for unavailable features

### Security
- Consider security implications of package installation
- Add safeguards against potentially harmful operations
- Implement rate limiting for expensive operations

### Performance
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Optimize subprocess calls
- Use async where appropriate for non-blocking operations
