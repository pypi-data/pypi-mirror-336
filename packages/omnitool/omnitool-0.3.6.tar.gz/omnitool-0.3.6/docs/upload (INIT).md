POST media/upload (INIT)
Overview
The INIT command request is used to initiate a file upload session. It returns a media_id which should be used to execute all subsequent requests. The next step after a successful return from INIT command is the APPEND command.

See the Uploading media guide for constraints and requirements on media files.

Request
Requests should be either multipart/form-data or application/x-www-form-urlencoded POST formats.

Response

The entire file must be uploaded before expires_after_secs seconds.

The additional_owners field enables media to be uploaded media as user A and then used to create Tweets as user B.
