POST media/upload (APPEND)
Overview
The APPEND command is used to upload a chunk (consecutive byte range) of the media file. For example, a 3 MB file could be split into 3 chunks of size 1 MB, and uploaded using 3 APPEND command requests. After the entire file is uploaded, the next step is to call the FINALIZE command.

There are a number of advantages of uploading a media file in small chunks:

Improved reliability and success rates under low bandwidth network conditions
Uploads can be paused and resumed
File chunks can be retried individually
Ability to tune chunk sizes to match changing network conditions e.g on cellular clients
Request
Requests should be multipart/form-data POST format.
