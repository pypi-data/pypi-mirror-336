A comprehensive Python package for calculating sample sizes in medical diagnostic studies. This package implements a wide range of statistical methods for diagnostic research, including:

- Sample size calculations for diagnostic accuracy studies
- ROC curve analysis
- Comparison of multiple diagnostic tests
- Non-inferiority and equivalence testing
- Multi-reader multi-case (MRMC) study design

## Installation

```bash
pip install spcal
```

## Quick Start

```python
import spcal as spc

# Calculate sample size for a study using a two-sided confidence interval
n = spc.two_sided_CI_sample_size(var=0.25, alpha=0.05, L=0.1)
print(f"Required sample size: {n}")

# Calculate AUC variance
variance = spc.AUC_variance_binormal(A=0.85, R=1.5)
print(f"AUC variance: {variance:.6f}")

# Compare two diagnostic tests
n = spc.sample_size_for_two_diagnostic_tests(
    alpha=0.05, 
    beta=0.2, 
    delta=0.1, 
    Se1=0.85, 
    Se2=0.75, 
    coPos=0.6
)
print(f"Sample size for comparison: {n}")
```
