# HPFC: High-Performance Folder Compare

A high-performance command-line tool for comparing folders and generating detailed reports on file differences.
This tool supports cross-platform operation (Windows, Linux, and macOS) and can efficiently handle large volumes of files and large file sizes.

## Features

- Compare files in two folders for content differences
- Detect and report three types of inconsistencies:
  - Files with different content
  - Missing files (present in folder1 but not in folder2)
  - Extra files (present in folder2 but not in folder1)
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, and macOS)
- Uses chunked hash comparison algorithm for efficient handling of large files (up to tens of GB)
- Multi-process parallel processing for improved performance
- File and folder ignore patterns
- Detailed reports in both text and HTML formats with GitHub and PyPI links
- Interactive progress bar with ETA display
- Handles tens or hundreds of thousands of files efficiently

## Installation

### Using pip

```bash
pip install hpfc-tool
```

> **Note:** The package name is `hpfc-tool` and the command-line tool is `hpfc`.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethan-li/hpfc.git
cd hpfc
pip install .
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
hpfc folder1 folder2
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
hpfc folder1 folder2 [options]
```

Options:
- `-c`, `--chunk-size`: Chunk size in bytes for comparing large files (default: 8MB)
- `-w`, `--workers`: Number of worker processes for parallel processing (default: CPU count)
- `-i`, `--ignore`: Patterns to ignore (can specify multiple)
- `-o`, `--output`: Save report to specified file (default: console output)
- `--html`: Generate an HTML report instead of text
- `--no-progress`: Disable progress bar display
- `-v`, `--version`: Show version information

### Examples

Compare two folders:
```bash
hpfc /path/to/folder1 /path/to/folder2
```

Ignore specific files or folders:
```bash
hpfc /path/to/folder1 /path/to/folder2 --ignore ".git" "*.log" "temp"
```

Adjust chunk size for large file comparison:
```bash
hpfc /path/to/folder1 /path/to/folder2 --chunk-size 16777216  # 16MB
```

Specify number of worker processes:
```bash
hpfc /path/to/folder1 /path/to/folder2 --workers 4
```

Save report to file:
```bash
hpfc /path/to/folder1 /path/to/folder2 --output report.txt
```

Generate HTML report:
```bash
hpfc /path/to/folder1 /path/to/folder2 --html --output report.html
```

### Exit Codes

- `0`: All files are identical
- `1`: There are different files, missing files, extra files, or error files

## Performance Considerations

- For large files (>8MB), the tool uses chunked hash comparison instead of full file loading to avoid memory overflow
- For small files, direct content comparison is used, which is generally faster than hash calculation
- The tool uses multi-process parallel processing for file comparison to utilize multi-core CPUs
- Performance priority: files are first compared by size, and only if sizes match are contents compared

## Running Tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

To skip large file tests (which may take some time):
```bash
SKIP_LARGE_FILE_TEST=1 python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## Notes

- This tool is specifically designed for handling large volumes of files and large file sizes
- Binary and text files are compared in the same way (exact content comparison)
- Ignore patterns use simple substring matching, not wildcards or regular expressions
- HTML reports provide an interactive and visual representation of comparison results
