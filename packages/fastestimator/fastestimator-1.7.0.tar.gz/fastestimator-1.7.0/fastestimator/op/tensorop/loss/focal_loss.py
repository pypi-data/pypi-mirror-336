    """Calculate Focal Loss.

    Original implementation from https://github.com/facebookresearch/fvcore/blob/master/fvcore/nn/focal_loss.py .
    Loss used in RetinaNet for dense detection: https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002.

    Args:
        inputs: A tuple or list like: [y_pred, y_true].
        outputs: String key under which to store the computed loss value.
        alpha: Weighting factor in range (0,1) to balance
                positive vs negative examples or -1 to ignore. Default = 0.25
        gamma: Exponent of the modulating factor (1 - p_t) to
               balance easy vs hard examples.
        sample_reduction: 'none' | 'mean' | 'sum'
                 'none': No reduction will be applied to the output.
                 'mean': The output will be averaged.
                 'sum': The output will be summed.
        shape_reduction:
                 'none' | 'mean' | 'sum'
                 'none': No reduction will be applied to the output.
                 'mean': The output will be averaged across classes.
                 'sum': The output will be summed across classes.
        from_logits: Whether y_pred is logits (without sigmoid).
        normalize: Whether to normalize focal loss along samples based on number of positive classes per samples.
        mode: What mode(s) to execute this Op in. For example, "train", "eval", "test", or "infer". To execute
            regardless of mode, pass None. To execute in all modes except for a particular one, you can pass an
            argument like "!infer" or "!train".
