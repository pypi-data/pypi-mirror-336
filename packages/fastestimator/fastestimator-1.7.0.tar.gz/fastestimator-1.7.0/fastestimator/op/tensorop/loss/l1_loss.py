    """Calculate the L1 loss between two tensors.

    This LossOp can be used to Implement:
        L1 loss: Is a criterion that calculates Mean Absolute Error between the elements ([y_pred, y_true]).
        Smooth_L1 loss: Is a criterion that uses squared loss if absolute element wise subtraction (y_pred - y_true) is less than
                        'beta' and vanilla L1 loss otherwise.
        Huber loss: Is a criterion that uses squared loss if absolute element wise subtraction (y_pred - y_true) is less than
                    'beta' and a 'beta' scaled L1 loss otherwise.


    Args:
        inputs: A tuple or list like: [y_pred, y_true].
        outputs: String key under which to store the computed loss.
        mode: What mode(s) to execute this Op in. For example, "train", "eval", "test", or "infer". To execute
            regardless of mode, pass None. To execute in all modes except for a particular one, you can pass an argument
            like "!infer" or "!train".
        ds_id: What dataset id(s) to execute this Op in. To execute regardless of ds_id, pass None. To execute in all
            ds_ids except for a particular one, you can pass an argument like "!ds1".
        average_loss: Whether to average the element-wise loss after the Loss Op.
        loss_type: What type of L1 loss. Can either be 'L1' (L1 Loss), 'Smooth' (Smooth L1 Loss) or 'Huber' (Huber loss). Default:'L1'
        beta: A threshold at which to change between L1 and L2 loss. Needs to be a positive number. Default:1.0 . dtype: float16 or float32.
