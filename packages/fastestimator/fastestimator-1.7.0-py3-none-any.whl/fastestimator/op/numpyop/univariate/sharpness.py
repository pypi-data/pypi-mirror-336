    """Randomly change the sharpness of an image.

    This is a wrapper for functionality provided by the PIL library:
    https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/tree/master/src/PIL.

    Args:
        inputs: Key(s) of images to be modified.
        outputs: Key(s) into which to write the modified images.
        mode: What mode(s) to execute this Op in. For example, "train", "eval", "test", or "infer". To execute
            regardless of mode, pass None. To execute in all modes except for a particular one, you can pass an argument
            like "!infer" or "!train".
        ds_id: What dataset id(s) to execute this Op in. To execute regardless of ds_id, pass None. To execute in all
            ds_ids except for a particular one, you can pass an argument like "!ds1".
        limit: Factor range for changing sharpness. If limit is a single float, the range will be (-limit, limit).
            A factor of 0.0 gives a blurred image, a factor of 1.0 gives the original image, and a factor of 2.0 gives
            a sharpened image.
