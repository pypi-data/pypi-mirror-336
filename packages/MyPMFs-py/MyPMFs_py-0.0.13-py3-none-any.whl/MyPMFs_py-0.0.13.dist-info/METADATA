# MyPMFs_py

The MYPMFs_py Package allows for use of mypmfs training and scoring of the statistical potentials of proteins. Additionally, includes batch download of files from the protein data bank. 

The underlying software package was obtained from https://github.com/bibip-impmc/mypmfs. Please cite the original work (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2018.05.013) if you use this package.

Includes the following functionality

batch_download - batch download of specified pdb files from the Protein Databank, can be called with batch_download(pdbCodeFile, outputDirPath)

training - executable binary to generate statistical potentials from set of pdb files can be called with training(pdbCodeFile, pdbDirPath, outputDirPath)

scoring - executable binary to generate pseudo-energy of specificed protein based off a pre-generated (using training) set of statistical potenitals can be called with scoring(pdbFile, potentialsDir)
