	 * Note that networks are always included when *calculating* plate statistics (eg, convergence/divergence) because

	 *       sections where two adjacent plates each connect to a separate topological section (instead of sharing the same one),
	 *       thus causing each topological section to connect only to a single plate (rather than both plates).
	 *       In this case a second intersection test is performed on all available resolved topological boundaries and networks.
