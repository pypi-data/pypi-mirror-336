	 * A 64-bit counter than can be incremented and equality or less-than compared.
	 *
	 * NOTE: The counter is not intended to be decrementable.
	 *
	 * NOTE: This incrementing can have problems due to integer overflow and subsequent wraparound
	 * back to zero but we're using 64-bit integers which, if we incremented every CPU cycle
	 * (ie, the fastest possible incrementing) on a 3GHz system it would take 195 years to overflow.
	 * So we are safe as long as we are guaranteed to use 64-bit integers (and for this there is
	 * 64-bit simulation code for those systems that only support 32-bit integers -
	 * which should be very few). Use of 32-bit integers brings this down from 195 years to
	 * a couple of seconds so 64-bit must be used.
