# and that you are creating a sibling directory 'gplates-build' or 'pygplates-build' (or both).
#
# For 'gplates':
#
#   mkdir gplates-build  # You should now see 'gplates-src/' and 'gplates-build/' side-by-side
#   cd gplates-build
#   cmake -D GPLATES_BUILD_GPLATES:BOOL=TRUE ../gplates-src  # Note the TRUE for building gplates
#   cmake --build .
#   cmake --install . --prefix staging  # Should now have a 'gplates-build/staging/' directory

#   cmake --build .
#   cmake --install . --prefix staging  # Should now have a 'pygplates-build/staging/' directory
#
# For GPlates, in most cases you wouldn't typically install directly like this. More likely you'd create a package
# using CPack (see Package.cmake) which will, in turn, install to its own staging area prior to creating a package.
# However for pyGPlates, the install phase is used by scikit-build-core to create a Python wheel (see pyproject.toml).

#
if (GPLATES_INSTALL_STANDALONE)

    #
    # Note that we don't get Qt to deploy its libraries/plugins to our install location (using windeployqt/macdeployqt).
    # Instead we find the Qt library dependencies ourself and we explicitly list the Qt plugins we expect to use.
    # On Windows: The official pre-built Qt binaries are configured for 'dynamic' OpenGL (see https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/windows-requirements.html).
    #             This means the normal desktop OpenGL drivers will be used where sufficient, otherwise Qt falls back to ANGLE or software OpenGL.
    #             This fallback relies on the ANGLE or software DLLs being present. They are dynamically loaded, rather than being dynamically linked, and
    #             so are not found by file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES) and so are not deployed. However 'windeployqt' will include those ANGLE and software DLLs.
    #             But the fact that we're not using 'windeployqt' is fine because GPlates uses OpenGL 3.3 which is above what ANGLE and software supports
    #             and so Qt cannot fallback. Hence not deploying the ANGLE and software DLLs is not a problem. GPlates also tells Qt not to fall back by
    #             specifying the Qt::AA_UseDesktopOpenGL attribute (in the C++ code).
    # On macOS:   The Qt deployment tool 'macdeployqt' actually deploys more than just the Qt libraries/plugins (and the libraries they depend on).
    #             It also deploys all libraries that GPlates depends on (eg, Boost, GDAL, etc). But we're already doing this via file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES)
    #             and we're explicitly listing the Qt plugins. So we don't really need to use 'macdeployqt'.
    #
    
    #
    # Run the deployment code in the install prefix location.
    #
    # This consists of a bunch of "install(CODE ...)" commands to install code into "cmake_install.cmake" that CMake in turn
    # executes at 'install' time into the install prefix location ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} (evaluated at 'install' time).
    #
    # Note: The command "install(CODE)" requires CMake 3.14 since we're using generator expressions in the code.
    #       And using FOLLOW_SYMLINK_CHAIN in file(INSTALL) requires CMake 3.15.
    #
    # Note: When using CODE with double quotes, as with install(CODE "<code>"), variable subsitution is *enabled*.
    #       So we use this when transferring variables.
    #       However when using square brackets, as with install(CODE [[<code>]]), variable subitition is *disabled* (as is escaping).
    #       So we use this for the bulk of code to avoid unwanted variable transfer (instead using variables defined at *install* time)
    #       and to avoid having to escape characters (like double quotes).
    #       An example of this is ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} where we use square brackets (CODE [[<code>]]) to ensure it is expanded only at
    #       install time (not at configure time). This is important because it can be different. For example, at configure time it might
    #       default to "c:/Program Files/${PROJECT_NAME}", but when packaging, the install prefix will instead be the staging area.
