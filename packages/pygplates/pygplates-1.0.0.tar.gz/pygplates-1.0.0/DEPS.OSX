Introduction

This page lists the package dependencies which need to be satisfied to be able
to build GPlates/pyGPlates from source on macOS.


Program and library dependencies

To compile GPlates/pyGPlates, you will need the following programs and libraries installed:

  • XCode (see "BUILD.OSX" for instructions on how to install)
  • cmake
  • make
  • GLEW library (the OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library)
  * Python
  • Boost library headers
  • Qt library
  • GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library)
  • CGAL (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library)
  • PROJ
  • Qwt
  • zlib

Note: The required versions of the dependencies are documented in "README.md".

Overview of different ways to install non-system dependencies

There are multiple ways to install the remaining dependencies.
You can use Macports (http://www.macports.org) or Homebrew (https://brew.sh/) or Fink (http://www.finkproject.org/).
Or you can compile the dependent packages directly from source code.
Or you can install the dependent packages using precompiled installer packages where available.


Installing non-system dependencies using Macports

Here we briefly describe how to install dependencies using Macports (http://www.macports.org):
  • Install Macports (http://www.macports.org) if it's not already installed (it will ask you to first install XCode).
  • Start a new terminal window (by running Applications->Utilities->Terminal in Finder).
  • You may need to set the path to Macports with "export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH".
  • Update Macports with 'sudo port -d selfupdate'.
  • Install CMake with 'sudo port install cmake' (or download an installer from http://www.cmake.org ).
  • Install GLEW with 'sudo port install glew'.
  • Install Python with 'sudo port install python3[x]' where 'x' is the minor version (eg, 'sudo port install python310').
    Also install NumPy with 'sudo port install py3[x]-numpy' (eg, 'sudo port install py310-numpy').
    Also install 'pip' with 'sudo port install py3[x]-pip' (eg, 'sudo port install py310-pip').
  • Install Boost with 'sudo port install boost +python3[x]'.
    Note the additional '+python3[x]' where 'x' is the python minor version number (eg, 'sudo port install boost +python310').
  • Install Qt with 'sudo port install qt5'.
  • Instal Qwt with 'sudo port install qwt-qt5'.
    This appears to install qwt inside qt5, and so it should get found once qt5 is found.
  • Install GDAL with 'sudo port install gdal +netcdf'.
    Note the additional "+netcdf" is required to enable GPlates to import/export NetCDF rasters.
  • Install PROJ with 'sudo port install proj'.
    Note that this will likely already be installed since it's a dependency of gdal (installed above).
  • Install CGAL with 'sudo port install cgal5'.
  • Install zlib with 'sudo port install zlib'.

For example, to install using Python 3.10:

    sudo port -N install cmake glew python310 py310-numpy py310-pip boost +python310 qt5 qwt-qt5 gdal +netcdf proj cgal5 zlib

...note the '-N' *prevents* Macports asking you to confirm dependencies for each port.


A note about Python

You may need to explicitly specify the Macports Python location. Otherwise the Python framework bundled inside
the XCode app will instead be found by CMake, which likely has a different Python minor version than the Macports Python
you've compiled/activated Macports Boost for, causing CMake to be unable to find boost_python3[x].

For example, if you installed Python 3.10 via Macports then you could build GPlates by typing (see BUILD.OSX):

    cmake -D Python3_ROOT:PATH=/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.10 .
    make

...or compile and install pyGPlates by typing (see BUILD.OSX):

    python -m pip install --config-settings cmake.define.Python3_ROOT=/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.10 .

Or, equivalently, first set the environment variable Python3_ROOT:

    export Python3_ROOT=/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.10

...and then build GPlates:

    cmake .
    make

...or compile and install pyGPlates:

    python -m pip install .


A note about Boost

If you get a CMake error like "Could NOT find Boost (missing: python310)" then you may need to create a symbolic link within Macports.
For example, if your Boost version is 1.76 (and Python version is 3.10) then you can create the symbolic link with:

    sudo ln -s /opt/local/libexec/boost/1.76/lib/libboost_python310-mt.dylib /opt/local/lib/libboost_python310-mt.dylib

If you have multiple Python versions then you'll also need corresponding boost port variants (due to boost-python).
However you'll need to add the variants to 'boost176' (for Boost 1.76) instead of just 'boost' (as was done above).
For example, you could add Python version 3.11 with:

    sudo port -N install python311 py311-numpy py311-pip boost176 +python311


A note about Qwt

If Qwt is not found (with a regular 'cmake .') then you can explicitly specify the Qwt include and library locations using QWT_INCLUDE_DIR and QWT_LIBRARY.
For example, the 'qwt-qt5' Macports package should get installed inside 'qt5', so something like the following might be required...

For GPlates:

    cmake -D QWT_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/opt/local/libexec/qt5/lib/qwt.framework/Headers -D QWT_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/opt/local/libexec/qt5/lib/qwt.framework .
    make

For pyGPlates:

    python -m pip install \
        --config-settings cmake.define.QWT_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/local/libexec/qt5/lib/qwt.framework/Headers \
        --config-settings cmake.define.QWT_LIBRARY=/opt/local/libexec/qt5/lib/qwt.framework \
        .


A note about GDAL

If you decide to compile GDAL from source (instead of using Macports) then ensure that GDAL links *statically*
to PROJ if the PROJ library is in a non-standard location. This ensures GPlates does not generate a dynamic
library loading error (for PROJ) when a raster with an inbuilt spatial reference system (eg, a projection) is loaded.
This does not appear to be necessary when using GDAL installed via Macports (since it statically links PROJ to GDAL).
You'll also need to ensure that the NetCDF library is installed and that GDAL is configured to use it - this is
necessary for GPlates to be able to load gridded rasters.
Here are the relevant options for the GDAL 2.x 'configure' script (assuming GDAL dependencies have been installed with Macports /opt/local/):

    configure --with-netcdf=/opt/local  --enable-netcdf4 --with-proj=/opt/local --with-threads --disable-static --without-grass --with-libtiff=/opt/local --with-jpeg=/opt/local --with-gif=/opt/local --with-png=/opt/local --with-geotiff=/opt/local --with-sqlite3=/opt/local --with-expat=/opt/local

...where '--enable-netcdf4' enables NetCDF version 4 which may require HDF5 '--with-hdf5=/path/to/hdf5' according to https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/NetCDF.
And if using a version of GDAL older than 3.0 then replace '--with-proj=/opt/local ' with '--with-static-proj4=/opt/local'.
