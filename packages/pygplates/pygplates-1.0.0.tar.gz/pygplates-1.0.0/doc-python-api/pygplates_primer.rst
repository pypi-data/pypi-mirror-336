Plate reconstruction hierarchy
------------------------------

.. note:: `Next-generation plate-tectonic reconstructions using GPlates <http://www.gplates.org/publications.html>`_
   contains a good introduction to plate reconstruction hierarchies.

A plate-reconstruction hierarchy consists of a tree of total reconstruction poles at an instant in geological time.

Plate motions are described in terms of relative rotations between pairs of plates.
Every plate in the model moves relative to some other plate where, within each
of these plate pairs, one plate is considered the *moving* plate relative to the
other *fixed* plate. That *fixed* plate, in turn, moves relative to another plate
thus forming a tree-like structure known as the *reconstruction tree*.
Each of these *relative* rotations is an *edge* in the tree.

The following diagram shows a subset of the hierarchy of relative rotations used in GPlates:
::

                  000
                   |
                   |  finite rotation (001 rel. 000)
                   |
                  001
                   |
                   |  finite rotation (701 rel. 001)
                   |
                  701(AFR)
                  /|\
                 / | \  finite rotation (802 rel. 701)
                /  |  \
             201  702  802(ANT)
              /   / \    \
             /   /   \    \  finite rotation (801 rel. 802)
            /   /     \    \
         202  704     705  801(AUS)
         / \
        /   \
       /     \
     290     291

...where *000* is the anchored plate (the top of the reconstruction tree).
The edge *802 rel. 701* contains the rotation of *802* (the moving plate in the pair) relative to
*701* (the fixed plate in the pair).

An *equivalent* rotation is the rotation of a plate relative to the *anchored* plate.
So the equivalent rotation of plate *802* is the composition of relative rotations along the
plate circuit *edge* path from anchored plate *000* to plate *802*.

A *relative* rotation is the rotation of one plate relative to *another* plate
(as opposed to the *anchored* plate). Note that, like *equivalent* rotations,
the plate circuit *edge* path can consist of one or more edges.
For example, the rotation of plate *801* relative to plate *291* follows an *edge*
path that goes via plates *202*, *201*, *701* and *802*. However it should be noted
that if the edge between *001* and *701* did not exist then, even though a path
would still exist between *291* and *801*, the *relative* rotation (and *equivalent*
rotations of *291* and *801* for that matter) would be an :meth:`identity rotation
<pygplates.FiniteRotation.represents_identity_rotation>`. This is because the sub-tree
below *001* would not get built into the reconstruction tree and hence all plates
in the sub-tree would be missing. This can happen when the rotation sequence
for a moving/fixed plate pair (eg, *701*/*101*) does not span a large enough time
period. You can work around this situation by setting the anchor plate to the relative plate
(eg, *291* in the above example).

A *total* rotation is a rotation at a time in the past relative to *present day* (0Ma).
In other words *from* present day *to* a past time.

A *stage* rotation is a rotation at a time in the past relative to *another* time
in the past.


.. _pygplates_primer_working_with_finite_rotations:

Working with finite rotations
-----------------------------

A finite rotation represents the motion of a plate (relative to another plate) on the surface of the
globe over a period of geological time.

In pyGPlates, finite rotations are represented by :class:`pygplates.FiniteRotation`.

In the following sections we will first cover some rotation maths and then derive the four
fundamental finite rotation categories:

* :ref:`pygplates_primer_equivalent_total_rotation`
* :ref:`pygplates_primer_relative_total_rotation`
* :ref:`pygplates_primer_equivalent_stage_rotation`
* :ref:`pygplates_primer_relative_stage_rotation`

In pyGPlates, these can be obtained from a :class:`pygplates.RotationModel`.


.. _pygplates_primer_composing_finite_rotations:

Composing finite rotations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following examples a composed rotation :math:`R2 \times R1` means the rotation :math:`R1`
is the first rotation to be applied followed by the rotation :math:`R2` such that a geometry is
rotated in the following way:

.. math::

   \text{geometry_final} &= R2 \times(R1 \times \text{geometry_initial}) \\
                         &= R2 \times R1 \times \text{geometry_initial}

...which is the equivalent of...

.. math::

   \text{geometry_intermediate} &= R1 \times \text{geometry_initial} \\
   \text{geometry_final} &= R2 \times \text{geometry_intermediate} \\
                         &= R2 \times (R1 \times \text{geometry_initial}) \\
                         &= R2 \times R1 \times \text{geometry_initial}

.. note:: Rotations are *not* commutative (:math:`R2 \times R1 \neq R1 \times R2`)

The composed rotation :math:`R2 \times R1` can be written in pyGPlates as either:
::

  R2 * R1

...or...
::

  pygplates.FiniteRotation.compose(R2, R1)

For example, the above geometry rotation can be written as either:
::

  geometry_final = R2 * R1 * geometry_initial

...or...
::

  geometry_final = pygplates.FiniteRotation.compose(R2, R1) * geometry_initial


.. _pygplates_primer_plate_circuit_paths:

Plate circuit paths
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The rotation from present day (0Ma) to the *geological time* :math:`t_{2}` (via time :math:`t_{1}`) is given by:

.. math::

   R(0 \rightarrow t_{2}) = R(t_{1} \rightarrow t_{2}) \times R(0 \rightarrow t_{1})

...or by post-multiplying both sides by :math:`R(t_{1} \rightarrow 0)`, and then swapping sides, this becomes...

.. math::

   R(0 \rightarrow t_{2}) \times R(t_{1} \rightarrow 0) &= R(t_{1} \rightarrow t_{2}) \times R(0 \rightarrow t_{1}) \times R(t_{1} \rightarrow 0) \\
   R(0 \rightarrow t_{2}) \times R(t_{1} \rightarrow 0) &= R(t_{1} \rightarrow t_{2}) \\
   R(t_{1} \rightarrow t_{2}) &= R(0 \rightarrow t_{2}) \times R(t_{1} \rightarrow 0)

The *plate circuit path* rotation from anchor plate :math:`P_{A}` to moving plate :math:`P_{M}` (via fixed plate :math:`P_{F}`) is given by:

.. math::

   R(P_{A} \rightarrow P_{M}) = R(P_{A} \rightarrow P_{F}) \times R(P_{F} \rightarrow P_{M})

...or by pre-multiplying both sides by :math:`R(P_{F} \rightarrow P_{A})` this becomes...

.. math::

   R(P_{F} \rightarrow P_{A}) \times R(P_{A} \rightarrow P_{M}) &= R(P_{F} \rightarrow P_{A}) \times R(P_{A} \rightarrow P_{F}) \times R(P_{F} \rightarrow P_{M}) \\
   R(P_{F} \rightarrow P_{A}) \times R(P_{A} \rightarrow P_{M}) &= R(P_{F} \rightarrow P_{M}) \\
   R(P_{F} \rightarrow P_{M}) &= R(P_{F} \rightarrow P_{A}) \times R(P_{A} \rightarrow P_{M})

Note that the rotations for relative times and for relative plates have the opposite order of each other !

In other words:

* For times :math:`0 \rightarrow t_{1} \rightarrow t_{2}` you apply the :math:`0 \rightarrow t_{1}` rotation first followed by the :math:`t_{1} \rightarrow t_{2}` rotation:
  
  .. math::

     R(0 \rightarrow t_{2})  = R(t_{1} \rightarrow t_{2}) \times R(0 \rightarrow t_{1})

* For plate circuit :math:`P_{A} \rightarrow P_{F} \rightarrow P_{M}` you apply the :math:`P_{F} \rightarrow P_{M}` rotation first followed by the :math:`P_{A} \rightarrow P_{F}` rotation:
  
  .. math::

     R(P_{A} \rightarrow P_{M}) = R(P_{A} \rightarrow P_{F}) \times R(P_{F} \rightarrow P_{M})

  .. note:: This is not :math:`P_{A} \rightarrow P_{F}` followed by :math:`P_{F} \rightarrow P_{M}` as you might expect (looking at the time example).

This is probably best explained by the difference between thinking in terms of the grand fixed
coordinate system and local coordinate system (see http://glprogramming.com/red/chapter03.html#name2).
Essentially, in the plate circuit :math:`P_{A} \rightarrow P_{F} \rightarrow P_{M}`, the :math:`P_{F} \rightarrow P_{M}` rotation can be thought of as a rotation
within the local coordinate system of :math:`P_{A} \rightarrow P_{F}`. In other words :math:`P_{F} \rightarrow P_{M}` is not a rotation that
occurs relative to the global spin axis but a rotation relative to the local coordinate system
of plate :math:`P_{F}` *after* it has been rotated relative to the anchor plate :math:`P_{A}`.

For the times :math:`0 \rightarrow t_{1} \rightarrow t_{2}` this local/relative coordinate system concept does not apply.

Note that a rotation must be relative to present day (0Ma) before it can be separated into a (plate circuit) chain of moving/fixed plate pairs.
Hence :math:`R(t_{1} \rightarrow t_{2},P_{A} \rightarrow P_{C}) \neq R(t_{1} \rightarrow t_{2},P_{A} \rightarrow P_{B}) \times R(t_{1} \rightarrow t_{2},P_{B} \rightarrow P_{C})`
demonstrates this mistake.

The following shows the correct way to separate :math:`P_{A} \rightarrow P_{C}` into the (plate circuit) chain of moving/fixed plate pairs :math:`P_{A} \rightarrow P_{B}` and :math:`P_{B} \rightarrow P_{C}`...

.. math::

   R(t_{1} \rightarrow t_{2},P_{A} \rightarrow P_{C}) \\
   & = R(0 \rightarrow t_{2},P_{A} \rightarrow P_{C}) \times R(t_{1} \rightarrow 0,P_{A} \rightarrow P_{C}) \\
   & = R(0 \rightarrow t_{2},P_{A} \rightarrow P_{C}) \times R(0 \rightarrow t_{1},P_{A} \rightarrow P_{C})^{-1} \\
   &   \text{// Now that all times are relative to 0Ma we can split } P_{A} \rightarrow P_{C} \text{ into } P_{A} \rightarrow P_{B} \rightarrow P_{C} \text{ ...} \\
   & = R(0 \rightarrow t_{2},P_{A} \rightarrow P_{B}) \times R(0 \rightarrow t_{2},P_{B} \rightarrow P_{C}) \times [R(0 \rightarrow t_{1},P_{A} \rightarrow P_{B}) \times R(0 \rightarrow t_{1},P_{B} \rightarrow P_{C})]^{-1} \\
   & = R(0 \rightarrow t_{2},P_{A} \rightarrow P_{B}) \times R(0 \rightarrow t_{2},P_{B} \rightarrow P_{C}) \times R(0 \rightarrow t_{1},P_{B} \rightarrow P_{C})^{-1} \times R(0 \rightarrow t_{1},P_{A} \rightarrow P_{B})^{-1}

...where :math:`P_{A} \rightarrow P_{B} \rightarrow P_{C}` means :math:`P_{B} \rightarrow P_{C}` is the rotation of :math:`P_{C}` relative to :math:`P_{B}` and :math:`P_{A} \rightarrow P_{B}` is
the rotation of :math:`P_{B}` relative to :math:`P_{A}`. The need for rotation :math:`P_{A} \rightarrow P_{C}` to be relative
to present day (0Ma) before it can be split into :math:`P_{A} \rightarrow P_{B}` and :math:`P_{B} \rightarrow P_{C}` is because
:math:`P_{A} \rightarrow P_{B}` and :math:`P_{B} \rightarrow P_{C}` are defined (in the rotation file) as total reconstruction
poles which are always relative to present day.

.. note:: | The inverse of rotation :math:`R` is denoted :math:`R^{-1}`.
          | Such that :math:`R \times R^{-1} = R^{-1} \times R = I` where :math:`I` is the :meth:`identify rotation<pygplates.FiniteRotation.represents_identity_rotation>`.

Topologies
----------

This section covers topologies in pyGPlates.

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 4

.. _pygplates_primer_topological_model:

Topological model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A topological model is represented by a :class:`pygplates.TopologicalModel`.
It can be created from topological features (in files, :class:`features <pygplates.Feature>` or
:class:`feature collections <pygplates.FeatureCollection>`) and a rotation model (created from rotation files,
:class:`features <pygplates.Feature>` or :class:`feature collections <pygplates.FeatureCollection>`):
::

   rotation_model = pygplates.RotationModel('rotations.rot')
   topological_model = pygplates.TopologicalModel('topologies.gpml', rotation_model)

.. note:: Alternatively you can just pass the rotation filenames (or features) directly into the topological model:
   ::

      topological_model = pygplates.TopologicalModel('topologies.gpml', 'rotations.rot')

You can also control *how* topologies are resolved using :class:`pygplates.ResolveTopologyParameters` -
currently these parameters only affect deforming networks.
This is done by specifying the ``default_resolve_topology_parameters`` - see
:ref:`pygplates_primer_strain_rate_clamping`, :ref:`pygplates_primer_strain_rate_smoothing` and
:ref:`pygplates_primer_exponential_rift_stretching_profile` for more details.

.. note:: You can also override the default parameters for each topological entry (eg, each file, feature collection or feature)
   by specifying a 2-tuple (topological entry, :class:`pygplates.ResolveTopologyParameters`) instead of just the topological entry.

A topological model can:

* Create a :ref:`pygplates_primer_topological_snapshot` at a reconstruction time.
* :ref:`pygplates_primer_topologically_reconstruct_geometries` over a time range.

.. _pygplates_primer_topological_snapshot:

Topological snapshot
""""""""""""""""""""

A topological snapshot is represented by a :class:`pygplates.TopologicalSnapshot`.
It can be created by resolving a :class:`pygplates.TopologicalModel` to a specific reconstruction time.
For example, to create a topological snapshot for each reconstruction time from 0 to 1000Ma in 1Myr increments:
::

   for reconstruction_time in range(1000):
      topological_snapshot = topological_model.topological_snapshot(reconstruction_time)

Alternatively, a topological snapshot can be created directly from topological features and a rotation model
(similar to :ref:`how a topological model is created <pygplates_primer_topological_model>`) and a reconstruction time:
::

   for reconstruction_time in range(1000):
      topological_snapshot = pygplates.TopologicalSnapshot('topologies.gpml', rotation_model, reconstruction_time)

.. note:: It is more efficient to generate snapshots from a :class:`pygplates.TopologicalModel` (rather than explicity using
   ``pygplates.TopologicalSnapshot(...)``). This is because a topological model only needs to read/parse the input topological and
   rotation features once, rather than at each time step. And also, the topological snapshots are cached internally within the
   topological model, so requesting the same snapshot again (at the same reconstruction time) will not require the topologies to
   be resolved again (at that reconstruction time).

A topological snapshot can:

* Generate :ref:`pygplates_primer_plate_boundary_statistics` (like convergence/divergence) along plate boundaries.

.. _pygplates_primer_plate_boundary_statistics:

Plate boundary statistics
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

.. note:: The following sample codes use plate boundary statistics:

   * :ref:`pygplates_find_divergence_at_subduction_zones_and_convergence_at_ridges`

Statistics at uniformly spaced points along plate boundaries can be generated from a topological snapshot using
:meth:`pygplates.TopologicalSnapshot.calculate_plate_boundary_statistics`.
For example, to generate statistics at points spaced 1 degree apart (along all plate boundaries):
::

   uniform_point_spacing_radians = math.radians(1)
   plate_boundary_stats = topological_snapshot.calculate_plate_boundary_statistics(uniform_point_spacing_radians)

You can also restrict which plate boundaries to generate points along.
For example, to generate points only along subduction zones and mid-ocean ridges:
::

   plate_boundary_stats = topological_snapshot.calculate_plate_boundary_statistics(
         uniform_point_spacing_radians,
         boundary_section_filter = [pygplates.FeatureType.gpml_subduction_zone,
                                    pygplates.FeatureType.gpml_mid_ocean_ridge])

...or even define your own criteria as a filter function accepting a single argument of type :class:`pygplates.ResolvedTopologicalSection`
and returning ``True`` if uniform points should be generated along that boundary section. For example, the equivalent of the above
example (generating points only along subduction zones and mid-ocean ridges) would be:
::

   def boundary_section_filter_function(resolved_topological_section):
      feature_type = resolved_topological_section.get_feature().get_feature_type()
      return (feature_type == pygplates.FeatureType.gpml_subduction_zone or
              feature_type == pygplates.FeatureType.gpml_mid_ocean_ridge)
   
   plate_boundary_stats = topological_snapshot.calculate_plate_boundary_statistics(
         uniform_point_spacing_radians,
         boundary_section_filter = boundary_section_filter_function)

.. note:: You can also group uniform points with the :class:`shared sub-segment <pygplates.ResolvedTopologicalSharedSubSegment>`
   they came from by setting :meth:`return_shared_sub_segment_dict <pygplates.TopologicalSnapshot.calculate_plate_boundary_statistics>` to ``True``.

Each point gets its own statistic represented by a :class:`pygplates.PlateBoundaryStatistic`.
For example, to query the uniformly spaced point locations and their convergence velocity magnitudes and obliquities:
::

   for stat in plate_boundary_stats:
      boundary_point = stat.boundary_point
      if convergence_velocity is not None:  # make sure the left and right plates exist
         convergence_velocity_magnitude = stat.convergence_velocity_magnitude
         convergence_velocity_obliquity = stat.convergence_velocity_obliquity

There are many other :class:`statistics <pygplates.PlateBoundaryStatistic>` such as plate *boundary* velocity, plate boundary *normal* direction,
left and right plate velocities, left and right plate identifiers (ie, which plate, or deforming network, is left and right of the point)
and distance to the ends of the boundary section (containing the point).

.. _pygplates_primer_topologically_reconstruct_geometries:

Topologically reconstruct geometries
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. note:: The following sample codes use topological reconstruction:

   * :ref:`pygplates_reconstruct_strain_and_strain_rate`
   * :ref:`pygplates_reconstruct_crustal_thickness_and_tectonic_subsidence`

Usually features are reconstructed using :class:`pygplates.ReconstructModel`, which relies only on the properties of the features
(such as their reconstruction plate IDs) to reconstruct them to past geological times.

An alternative approach is to use topologies (topological closed plate polygons and networks) to reconstruct an initial geometry.
In this case it is the topological plates and networks that determine how the geometry moves over time.
In other words, the geometry rigidly rotates when it is in rigid plates and deforms when it is in deforming networks.

.. _pygplates_primer_what_is_topological_reconstruction:

What is topological reconstruction?
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Topological reconstruction is an incremental process whereby each point in an initial geometry is reconstructed over a time period by dividing
that time period into a series of smaller time intervals. Within each time interval, the geometry at the start of the interval is reconstructed
to the end of the interval using the resolved topologies (at the start of the interval). This incremental reconstruction is performed iteratively
over the full time period to obtain a history of reconstruction snapshots (of the geometry), with each snapshot occupying a time slot.

For each new time interval, the resolved topologies can change, such as plates splitting/merging and deforming networks appearing/disappearing.
So at the start of each time interval, each point of the geometry is tested to see which topological plate or network it lies within
(with higher priority given to networks since they typically overlay the rigid plates). Then each point is reconstructed over the time interval
using the topological plate (see :meth:`pygplates.ResolvedTopologicalBoundary.reconstruct_point`) or topological network
(see :meth:`pygplates.ResolvedTopologicalNetwork.reconstruct_point`) that the point lies within.

Since topological reconstruction is peformed using topologies, no feature properties are needed (in contrast with non-topological reconstruction
using :class:`pygplates.ReconstructModel`). However, if a geometry point does not intersect any resolved topologies during a time interval then an
optional reconstruction plate ID is used to *rigidly* reconstruct it over that time interval. And if a reconstruction plate ID was not provided then
the point does not move over that time interval.

.. note:: Some geometry points can fail to intersect topologies if the topologies are regional (instead of global), or if there are cracks
   between adjacent topologies (due to the way they were built).

Deactivating points
*******************

The history of reconstruction snapshots covers a time range from an oldest time to a youngest time. And the initial geometry is provided at an
initial time (that can be inside or outside that time range). Hence an initial geometry can be topologically reconstructed forward in time, or
backward in time, or both, depending on where the initial time is in relation to the oldest and youngest times.

Initially all geometry points are active at the *initial time*, but can get progressively deactivated as they are topologically reconstructed
*away* from the initial time. When a point is deactivated it becomes inactive and is no longer topologically reconstructed for subsequent
time slots (*further* from the initial time). When reconstructed *forward* in time, points on oceanic crust get deactivated as they are subducted.
And when reconstructed *backward* in time, they get deactivated as they reach their time of appearance (at a mid-ocean ridge).

Using topological reconstruction
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Topological reconstruction requires a :class:`pygplates.TopologicalModel` and a geometry. Currently the geometry can only be one or more points.
Then :meth:`pygplates.TopologicalModel.reconstruct_geometry` can be used to generate a reconstructed history of snapshots of the geometry points,
and associated quantities (like velocity), that are stored in the returned :class:`pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan`.
For example, to topologically reconstruct points from their initial positions at 100 Ma to present day, in increments of 1 Myr:
::

   # Convert from latitudes and longitudes to a list of pygplates.PointOnSphere.
   lats = [...]  # point latitudes
   lons = [...]  # point longitudes
   points = [pygplates.PointOnSphere(lat, lon) for lat, lon in zip(lats, lons)]

   reconstructed_geometry_time_span = topological_model.reconstruct_geometry(
         points,
         initial_time=100)

The returned :class:`pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan` contains 101 reconstructed snapshots of the initial geometry in its history.
You can use it to query the reconstructed geometry at any reconstruction time. For example, to query the reconstructed points at 50 Ma:
::

   reconstructed_points = reconstructed_geometry_time_span.get_geometry_points(50)

   if reconstructed_points:
      # Convert from a list of pygplates.PointOnSphere to a list of (latitude, longitude) tuples.
      reconstructed_lat_lons = [point.to_lat_lon() for point in reconstructed_points]

.. seealso:: :ref:`pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span` for more details on querying reconstruction snapshots.

.. _pygplates_primer_using_topological_reconstruction_time_spans:

Time spans
**********

The time span of snapshots is determined by the oldest and youngest times.

In the above example, points were reconstructed *forward* in time (from 100 Ma to present day).
So the oldest time was 100 Ma and the youngest was 0 Ma.

You can also reconstruct *backward* in time. For example, to reconstruct from present day to 100 Ma, in increments of 1 Myr:
::

   reconstructed_geometry_time_span = topological_model.reconstruct_geometry(
         points,
         initial_time=0,
         oldest_time=100)

...where we needed to explicitly specify ``oldest_time`` because otherwise it defaults to ``initial_time`` (which in this example is present day).

.. note:: Even though the reconstruction is *backward* in time, the oldest and youngest times are still 100 Ma and 0 Ma, respectively.

In the above cases, the youngest time defaults to present day. However you can explicitly set it using the ``youngest_time`` argument.
For example, if you only want a history of snapshots from 100 Ma to 50 Ma (instead of 100 Ma to present day):
::

   reconstructed_geometry_time_span = topological_model.reconstruct_geometry(
         points,
         initial_time=0,
         oldest_time=100,
         youngest_time=50)

It's also possible to reconstruct both *forward* and *backward* in time. This happens when the initial time is *between* the oldest and youngest times.
For example, if the initial points are at 50 Ma but you want a time range of snapshots from 100 Ma to present day:
::

   reconstructed_geometry_time_span = topological_model.reconstruct_geometry(
         points,
         initial_time=50,
         oldest_time=100)

In this case, the initial points are reconstructed both *forward* in time from 50 Ma to present day **and** *backward* in time from 50 Ma to 100 Ma
(in order to generate all snapshots from 100 Ma to present day).

You can also choose the time interval between reconstruction snapshots using the ``time_increment`` argument (which defaults to 1 Myr).
The time increment, along with the oldest and youngest times, determine the time slots.

.. note:: ``oldest_time - youngest_time`` must be an integer multiple of ``time_increment``.

If you choose a large time increment then the snapshots will be spaced farther apart and the resulting reconstruction accuracy will suffer.
Another source of inaccuracy is due to the initial time of the initial geometry being internally snapped to the nearest time slot.
For these reasons the time increment defaults to 1 Myr (which is typically the smallest time resolution used in topological models).

.. _pygplates_primer_using_topological_reconstruction_reconstruction_plate_id:

Reconstruction plate ID
***********************

In the above cases, the geometry is already in the correct position at the initial time. In other words, the geometry is a snapshot at the initial time.
For example, it could be uniform points spread across the entire globe at the initial time (and we want to see where they end up at other times).
So we did **not** specify the ``reconstruction_plate_id`` argument.

However if the geometry is a *present day* geometry localised to a specific plate (and the initial time is in the past) then specifying a
reconstruction plate ID will reconstruct it to the initial time (to become the snapshot at the initial time, before topologically reconstruction into
the other snapshots proceeds). For example, if the geometry represents its present day position on plate 701 (and we're reconstructing *forward* in time
from 100 Ma to present day) then:
::

   reconstructed_geometry_time_span = topological_model.reconstruct_geometry(
         points_at_present_day,
         initial_time=100,
         reconstruction_plate_id=701)

...will first rigidly reconstruct ``points_at_present_day`` from present day to 100 Ma using plate ``701``, and then topologically reconstruct them
from 100 Ma to present day (generating snapshots at 1 Myr intervals).

.. note:: ``reconstruction_plate_id`` also has other purposes. For example, when
   :ref:`generating the history of snapshots <pygplates_primer_what_is_topological_reconstruction_reconstruction_plate_id>` and when
   :ref:`querying geometry points <pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_geometry_points>`.

.. _pygplates_primer_using_topological_reconstruction_deactivating_points:

Deactivating points
*******************

By default, geometry points can get progressively deactivated when they are topologically reconstructed away from the initial time.
This is useful for points on *oceanic* crust because that crust can get subducted, and it is typically younger than continental crust.
Therefore, oceanic points will get deactivated as they are subducted going *forward* in time and deactivated as they reach their time of appearance
(at mid-ocean ridges) going *backward* in time. This is the default behaviour and works for both oceanic and continental crust.

To disable this ability you can explicitly set the ``deactivate_points`` argument to ``None``. Then the points will always remain active.
This can be used (but is not necessary) when the points are all within the interior of *continents* (where crust exists at present day and has existed
for a long time). For example, to reconstruct *continental* points forward in time from 100 Ma to present day (without attempting to deactivate any):
::

   reconstructed_geometry_time_span = topological_model.reconstruct_geometry(
         points,
         initial_time=100,
         deactivate_points=None)

You can also change *how* points are deactivated, by either:

* changing the parameters of the *default* deactivation algorithm, or
* implementing your own deactivation algorithm.

The *default* deactivation algorithm is implemented in :class:`pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.DefaultDeactivatePoints`.

To use the *default* parameters of the *default* deactivation algorithm you don't need to specify the ``deactivate_points`` argument.
For example, you can just call:
::

   topological_model.reconstruct_geometry(
         points,
         initial_time=100)

...since that is equivalent to calling:
::

   topological_model.reconstruct_geometry(
         points,
         initial_time=100,
         deactivate_points=pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.DefaultDeactivatePoints())

However, you can change the parameters of the *default* deactivation algorithm.
For example, when reconstructing *oceanic* points (forward in time from 100 Ma to present day):
::

   reconstructed_geometry_time_span = topological_model.reconstruct_geometry(
         points,
         initial_time=100,
         deactivate_points=pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.DefaultDeactivatePoints(
               # Choose our own parameters that are different than the defaults...
               threshold_velocity_delta = 0.9, # cms/yr
               threshold_distance_to_boundary = 15, # kms/myr
               deactivate_points_that_fall_outside_a_network = True))

You can also implement your own deactivation algorithm by implementing your own class that inherits from
:class:`pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.DeactivatePoints` and overrides its
:meth:`deactivate method <pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.DeactivatePoints.deactivate>`.

.. note:: This is what the *default* deactivation algorithm does.
   In other words, the :class:`DefaultDeactivatePoints <pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.DefaultDeactivatePoints>` class
   inherits from the :class:`DeactivatePoints <pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.DeactivatePoints>` class.

.. seealso:: :class:`pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.DeactivatePoints` for more details.

.. _pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span:

Reconstructed geometry time span
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

A :class:`pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan` contains a history of reconstruction snapshots generated by :meth:`pygplates.TopologicalModel.reconstruct_geometry`.

Each snapshot stores the following quantities:

* :ref:`pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_geometry_points`
* :ref:`pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_velocities`
* :ref:`pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_topology_locations`
* :ref:`pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_strain_rates`
* :ref:`pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_strains`
* :ref:`pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_scalar_values`

  * :ref:`pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_crustal_thickness_factors`
  * :ref:`pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_tectonic_subsidence`

The history of snapshots is stored in time slots defined by :meth:`pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.get_time_span` whose time range is
determined by the *oldest_time* and *youngest_time* arguments of :meth:`pygplates.TopologicalModel.reconstruct_geometry`.
For example, to iterate over the *stored* history of :ref:`reconstructed geometry points <pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_geometry_points>`
(from oldest time to youngest time):
::

   oldest_time, youngest_time, time_increment, num_time_slots = reconstructed_geometry_time_span.get_time_span()
   for time_slot in range(num_time_slots):
      reconstruction_time = oldest_time - time_slot * time_increment
      reconstructed_points = reconstructed_geometry_time_span.get_geometry_points(reconstruction_time)

However, you can query the snapshots at any *arbitrary* reconstruction time, it does not have to match a time slot.
And it can be outside the :meth:`time range <pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.get_time_span>` of snapshots
(although typically you would generate a time range that contains all desired reconstruction times).
For times not matching a time slot, the behaviour is defined separately for each snapshot quantity.

For example, to iterate over the reconstructed geometry points at 1Myr intervals (from oldest time to youngest time)
*regardless* of the time slot intervals (which could be larger than 1Myr):
::

   oldest_time, youngest_time, _, _ = reconstructed_geometry_time_span.get_time_span()
   reconstruction_time = oldest_time
   while reconstruction_time >= youngest_time:
      reconstructed_points = reconstructed_geometry_time_span.get_geometry_points(reconstruction_time)
      reconstruction_time -= 1.0

When querying the various quantities in a snapshot (such as points or their velocities), each query has a ``return_inactive_points`` argument.
It defaults to ``False`` so that only quantities associated with *active* points are returned. However, if you set it to ``True`` then
quantities associated with both *active* and *inactive* points are returned. Each inactive point will have a value of ``None``
(since quantities cannot be calculated at inactive points). This can be useful when you need to keep track of points and their quantities
over time, since you can use point indices (an integer index into an array of points) which is not possible otherwise. For example, to find the maximum
:ref:`velocity <pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_velocities>` of each point (in a geometry) over the time range of the snapshots:
::

   import numpy as np

   # The number of initial points in the geometry (initially all points are active).
   num_initial_points = len(initial_points)

   # A NumPy array of zeros (one for each point).
   # This will later get updated with the max velocity of each point (in the same order as the points).
   max_point_velocities = np.zeros(num_initial_points)

   # Topologically reconstruct the initial points from 100 Ma to present day (at 1 Myr intervals).
   reconstructed_geometry_time_span = topological_model.reconstruct_geometry(initial_points, initial_time=100)

   # Iterate over the time slots (100, 99, ..., 1, 0 Ma).
   oldest_time, youngest_time, time_increment, num_time_slots = reconstructed_geometry_time_span.get_time_span()
   for time_slot in range(num_time_slots):
      reconstruction_time = oldest_time - time_slot * time_increment

      # Get the velocity at each point (for each inactive point it will be 'None').
      reconstructed_velocities = reconstructed_geometry_time_span.get_velocities(
            reconstruction_time,
            return_inactive_points=True)
      
      # If all points are inactive (in the current time slot) then 'reconstructed_velocities' itself will be 'None'.
      #
      # Note: If it is 'None' then you could potentially finish here (because once all points are deactivated
      #       they can't be reactivated). However this depends on the order you visit the time slots. It's only
      #       possible if you start at the initial time (slot) which in our case happens to be the oldest time
      #       (since we're reconstructing *forward* in time from 100 Ma to present day).
      if reconstructed_velocities:
         # Iterate over all the points (some might be inactive).
         for point_index in range(num_initial_points):
            velocity = reconstructed_velocities[point_index]
            # If the current point is active (in the current time slot) then it will have a velocity.
            if velocity is not None:
               # See if velocity is the maximum for the current point over all time slots visited so far.
               velocity_magnitude = velocity.get_magnitude()
               if velocity_magnitude > max_point_velocities[point_index]:
                  max_point_velocities[point_index] = velocity_magnitude
   
   # Print out the maximum velocity of each geometry point.
   for point_index in range(num_initial_points):

      velocity_magnitude = max_point_velocities[point_index]
      print('Max velocity of point initially at lon/lat ({}, {}) is {} km/myr'.format(lon, lat, velocity_magnitude))

...where we've associated a (maximum) velocity with each initial geometry point (such that the maximum velocity, and initial position,
of any geometry point can be found using its ``point_index``).

If the requested reconstruction time matches a time slot in the :meth:`time span <pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.get_time_span>` then
the geometry points of the snapshot in that time slot are returned.

If the requested reconstruction time is *within* the :meth:`time range <pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.get_time_span>` of the snapshots,
but does not match a time slot, then the geometry points in the time slot (of the two time slots nearest the reconstruction time) that is closest
to the initial time (specified in :meth:`pygplates.TopologicalModel.reconstruct_geometry`) will be incrementally reconstructed (away from the initial time)
to the requested reconstruction time using :meth:`pygplates.ResolvedTopologicalBoundary.reconstruct_point` or :meth:`pygplates.ResolvedTopologicalNetwork.reconstruct_point`
(depending on which plate/network in the time slot each active point lies within). And those reconstructed points will be returned.

.. note:: The returned geometry points will have the same active status as the time slot they're incrementally reconstructed *from*.
   In other words, if a point is active in the source time slot then it'll also be active in the returned geometry points.

If the requested reconstruction time is *outside* the :meth:`time range <pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.get_time_span>` of the snapshots then the
reconstruction plate ID specified in :meth:`pygplates.TopologicalModel.reconstruct_geometry` will be used to *rigidly* reconstruct the geometry points from
the oldest time slot (if the requested reconstruction time is older), or from the youngest time slot (if the requested reconstruction time is younger),
to the requested reconstruction time. And those reconstructed points will be returned.

.. note:: The active status of the returned points will be the same as those in the oldest or youngest time slot. Which means there can still be active geometry points
   when the reconstruction time is *outside* the :meth:`time range <pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.get_time_span>` of the snapshots.

.. note:: If no reconstruction plate ID was specified then there will be no rigid rotation, and so the geometry points from the oldest or youngest time slot will
   effectively be returned. However typically you would generate a time range that contains all desired reconstruction times (so this situation would not typically occur).

.. note:: The reconstruction plate ID can also be used when the requested reconstruction time is *inside* the time range and some geometry points are
   *outside* all resolved topologies (and hence cannot be reconstructed by the topologies). This can happen if the topologies are regional (instead of global)
   or if there are cracks between adjacent topologies (due to the way they were built).

In all cases, if *none* of the geometry points are active at the reconstruction time then ``None`` will be returned.

.. _pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_topology_locations:

Topology locations
******************

A :class:`topology location <pygplates.TopologyPointLocation>` identifies the resolved topology boundary or network that contains a reconstructed geometry point,
or identifies no resolved topologies if the point does not intersect any.

The topology location of each reconstructed geometry point at a reconstruction time can be queried using :meth:`pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.get_topology_point_locations`:
::

   reconstructed_topology_locations = reconstructed_geometry_time_span.get_topology_point_locations(reconstruction_time)

   # If none of the points are active at 'reconstruction_time' then this will be 'None'.

A topology location is returned for each geometry point that is *active at the requested reconstruction time*
(see :ref:`pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_geometry_points`). If *none* of the points are active then ``None`` will be returned. 

If the requested reconstruction time is *within* the :meth:`time range <pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.get_time_span>` of the snapshots
then the returned topology locations are those of the geometry points in the time slot (of the two time slots nearest the reconstruction time)
that is closest to the initial time (specified in :meth:`pygplates.TopologicalModel.reconstruct_geometry`).

.. note:: The topology locations are at the time of the time slot (rather than the reconstruction time) because topologies are only resolved at the time slots.

If the requested reconstruction time is *outside* the :meth:`time range <pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.get_time_span>` of the snapshots then the returned
topology locations identify no resolved topologies. In other words, :meth:`pygplates.TopologyPointLocation.not_located_in_resolved_topology` will return ``True``
for each geometry point. This is because topologies are *not* resolved outside the time range.

   # If none of the points are active at 'reconstruction_time' then this will be 'None'.
   if reconstructed_velocities:
      ...

A velocity is calculated for each geometry point that is *active at the requested reconstruction time*
(see :ref:`pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_geometry_points`). If *none* of the points are active then ``None`` will be returned. 

If the requested reconstruction time is *within* the :meth:`time range <pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.get_time_span>` of the snapshots
then the returned velocities are calculated at the geometry points in the time slot (of the two time slots nearest the reconstruction time)
that is closest to the initial time (specified in :meth:`pygplates.TopologicalModel.reconstruct_geometry`).

.. note:: The velocities are calculated at the time of the time slot (rather than the reconstruction time), and at the positions of the active geometry points
   in the time slot (rather than the geometry points at the reconstruction time - see :ref:`pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_geometry_points`).
   So, this is more like a nearest neighbour interpolation (rather than a linear interpolation) of the two nearest time slots.
   This is done since velocities are calculated using topologies, which are only resolved at the time slots, and the active status of velocities
   needs to be synchronised with the geometry points.

The velocities are determined by the topologies (rigid plates and deforming networks) resolved at the time of the time slot using
:meth:`pygplates.ResolvedTopologicalBoundary.get_point_velocity` or :meth:`pygplates.ResolvedTopologicalNetwork.get_point_velocity`
(depending on which plate/network in the time slot each active point lies within).

If the requested reconstruction time is *outside* the :meth:`time range <pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.get_time_span>` of the snapshots then the
returned velocities are determined by the reconstruction plate ID specified in :meth:`pygplates.TopologicalModel.reconstruct_geometry`, and they're calculated
at the positions of the active geometry points at the reconstruction time (see :ref:`pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_geometry_points`).

.. note:: If no reconstruction plate ID was specified then the velocities will be zero.

.. note:: The reconstruction plate ID can also be used when the requested reconstruction time is *inside* the time range and some geometry points are

A strain rate is returned for each geometry point that is *active at the requested reconstruction time*
(see :ref:`pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_geometry_points`). If *none* of the points are active then ``None`` will be returned. 

If the requested reconstruction time is *within* the :meth:`time range <pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.get_time_span>` of the snapshots
then the returned strain rates are interpolated between the two time slots nearest the reconstruction time.

   some points from the time slot *closer* to the initial time (see :ref:`pygplates_primer_what_is_topological_reconstruction_deactivating_points`).
   For these points the strain rate is not interpolated (instead it's obtained from the time slot *closer* to the initial time).

(depending on which plate/network in the time slot each active point lies within). And the strain rate will be zero for each geometry point (in a time slot)
that is *not* within a deforming network.

If the requested reconstruction time is *outside* the :meth:`time range <pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.get_time_span>` of the snapshots then the

(see :ref:`pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_geometry_points`). If *none* of the points are active then ``None`` will be returned. 

If the requested reconstruction time is *within* the :meth:`time range <pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.get_time_span>` of the snapshots
then the returned strains are interpolated between the two time slots nearest the reconstruction time.

.. note:: The time slot *further* from the initial time (specified in :meth:`pygplates.TopologicalModel.reconstruct_geometry`) might have deactivated
   some points from the time slot *closer* to the initial time (see :ref:`pygplates_primer_what_is_topological_reconstruction_deactivating_points`).
   For these points the strain is not interpolated (instead it's obtained from the time slot *closer* to the initial time).

The strain of each geometry point is generated (in the time slots) by accumulating its strain rates *forward* in time, over the
:meth:`time range <pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.get_time_span>` of the snapshots, using :meth:`pygplates.Strain.accumulate`.
The initial strain of each active geometry point in the oldest time slot will be the *identity* strain (since deformation has not yet occurred).
And the accumulated strain of a geometry point will only change (going forward in time) if the point undergoes deformation
(ie, is in a deforming network in one or more time slots).

If the requested reconstruction time is *outside* the :meth:`time range <pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.get_time_span>` of the snapshots then the
returned strains will be identity strains (no deformation) if the requested reconstruction time is older than the oldest time slot, and will be the
accumulated strains of the youngest time slot if the requested reconstruction time is younger than the youngest time slot (since strains do not accumulate
outside the time range of the snapshots because strain rates are zero there).

.. _pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_scalar_values:

Scalar values
*************

Each geometry point can have one or more scalar values.
And each scalar value (per point) is associated with a :class:`scalar type <pygplates.ScalarType>`.

Each scalar *type* belongs to one of two categories:

*  *Built-in scalar types*: whose scalar values *change* over time due to deformation

   These are:

   * ``pygplates.ScalarType.gpml_crustal_thickness`` - see :ref:`pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_crustal_thickness_factors`
   * ``pygplates.ScalarType.gpml_crustal_stretching_factor`` - see :ref:`pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_crustal_thickness_factors`
   * ``pygplates.ScalarType.gpml_crustal_thinning_factor`` - see :ref:`pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_crustal_thickness_factors`
   * ``pygplates.ScalarType.gpml_tectonic_subsidence`` - see :ref:`pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_tectonic_subsidence`

   Scalar values for these scalar types are always available.
   
   And their initial scalar values have default values (at the initial time).
   Hence the *initial_scalars* argument of :meth:`pygplates.TopologicalModel.reconstruct_geometry` does not need to be specified.

*  *User-defined scalar types*: whose scalar values are *constant* over time

   .. note:: Even though these scalar values are constant (over time) they still get deactivated when their associated
      geometry points get deactivated.

   These can be any :class:`pygplates.ScalarType` that you define.
   They are simply a way to associate your own data with the reconstructed geometry points.

   Scalar values for these scalar types are *only* available if you define them
   (using the *initial_scalars* argument of :meth:`pygplates.TopologicalModel.reconstruct_geometry`).
   For example:
   ::

      # Define your own scalar types.
      my_scalar_type_0 = pygplates.ScalarType.create_gpml('MyScalarType_0')
      my_scalar_type_1 = pygplates.ScalarType.create_gpml('MyScalarType_1')

      # Define associated scalar values (one per geometry point per scalar type).
      my_scalar_type_0_values = [...]
      my_scalar_type_1_values = [...]

      reconstructed_geometry_time_span = topological_model.reconstruct_geometry(
            initial_points,
            initial_time = 100,
            # dict with two entries (each entry mapping a scalar type to its scalar values)...
            initial_scalars = { my_scalar_type_0 : my_scalar_type_0_values, my_scalar_type_1 : my_scalar_type_1_values })

   .. note:: The *built-in scalar types* are still available when *user-defined scalar types* are defined.

The scalar values of each reconstructed geometry point at a reconstruction time can be queried using
:meth:`pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.get_scalar_values`. By default this will return a ``dict`` mapping *all* scalar types
(built-in and any user-defined) to their scalar values. For example:
::

   # Get all active scalar values (associated with all built-in and user-defined scalar types).
   active_scalar_values = reconstructed_geometry_time_span.get_scalar_values(reconstruction_time)

   # If none of the points are active at 'reconstruction_time' then this will be 'None'.
   if active_scalar_values:
      
      # Extract the scalar values associated with the built-in scalar types.
      crustal_thicknesses_in_kms = active_scalar_values[pygplates.ScalarType.gpml_crustal_thickness]
      crustal_stretching_factors = active_scalar_values[pygplates.ScalarType.gpml_crustal_stretching_factor]
      crustal_thinning_factors = active_scalar_values[pygplates.ScalarType.gpml_crustal_thinning_factor]
      tectonic_subsidences = active_scalar_values[pygplates.ScalarType.gpml_tectonic_subsidence]

      # Extract the scalar values associated with the user-defined scalar types.
      my_active_scalar_values_0 = active_scalar_values[my_scalar_type_0]
      my_active_scalar_values_1 = active_scalar_values[my_scalar_type_1]

.. note:: Alternatively, you can specify a scalar type directly to :meth:`pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.get_scalar_values`.
   For example:
   ::
   
      my_active_scalar_values_0 = reconstructed_geometry_time_span.get_scalar_values(
            reconstruction_time,
            my_scalar_type_0)

A scalar value (per scalar type) is returned for each geometry point that is *active at the requested reconstruction time*
(see :ref:`pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_geometry_points`). If *none* of the points are active then ``None`` will be returned. 

If the requested reconstruction time is *within* the :meth:`time range <pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.get_time_span>` of the snapshots
then the returned scalar values are those of the geometry points in the time slot (of the two time slots nearest the reconstruction time)
that is closest to the initial time (specified in :meth:`pygplates.TopologicalModel.reconstruct_geometry`).

.. note:: This is at the time of the time slot (rather than the reconstruction time), so this is more like a nearest neighbour interpolation
   (rather than a linear interpolation) of the two nearest time slots. This only matters for built-in scalar types since user-defined
   scalar types are constant over time.

If the requested reconstruction time is *outside* the :meth:`time range <pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.get_time_span>` of the snapshots then the
returned scalar values will be from the oldest time slot (if the requested reconstruction time is older) or from the youngest time slot
(if the requested reconstruction time is younger).

.. _pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_crustal_thickness_factors:

Crustal thickness factors
*************************

The crustal thickness factor :math:`F(t) = \frac{T(t)}{T(t_{initial})}` measures the ratio of the crustal thickness
at a reconstruction time :math:`T(t)` to the initial crustal thickness at the initial time :math:`T(t_{initial})`.
It is only calculated internally, and always has a value of ``1.0`` at the initial time (:math:`F(t_{initial}) = 1.0`).

Publicly, there are three built-in :ref:`scalar values <pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_scalar_values>`
that depend on the internal crustal thickness factor :math:`F(t)`:

*  *Crustal thickness* (in kms): :math:`T(t)`

   The crustal thickness is calculated as:

   :math:`T(t) = F(t) \, T(t_{initial})`

   By default, the initial crustal thickness :math:`T(t_{initial})` is ``40`` kms.
   But you can specify a different value for each initial geometry point:
   ::

      # Specify one initial crustal thickness (in kms) per initial point.
      initial_crustal_thicknesses_in_kms = [...]

      reconstructed_geometry_time_span = topological_model.reconstruct_geometry(

            initial_scalars = { pygplates.ScalarType.gpml_crustal_thickness : initial_crustal_thicknesses_in_kms })
   
   The crustal thicknesses can be queried at any reconstruction time using
   :meth:`pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.get_crustal_thicknesses`:
   ::

      reconstructed_crustal_thicknesses_in_kms = reconstructed_geometry_time_span.get_crustal_thicknesses(

   By default, the initial crustal stretching factor :math:`\beta(t_{initial})` is ``1``.
   And so the crustal stretching factor is calculated as:

   And so the crustal thinning factor is calculated as:

Tectonic subsidence
*******************

Tectonic subsidence is one of the built-in :ref:`scalar values <pygplates_primer_reconstructed_geometry_time_span_scalar_values>` that evolves over time due to deformation.
By default, the initial tectonic subsidence (at the initial time) is zero for each geometry point.
However you can optionally specify your own initial tectonic subsidence values (using the *initial_scalars* argument of :meth:`pygplates.TopologicalModel.reconstruct_geometry`):
::

   # Specify one initial tectonic subsidence value (in kms) per initial point.
   initial_tectonic_subsidences_in_kms = [...]

   reconstructed_geometry_time_span = topological_model.reconstruct_geometry(

         initial_scalars = { pygplates.ScalarType.gpml_tectonic_subsidence : initial_tectonic_subsidences_in_kms })

.. note:: The default (zero tectonic subsidence at the initial time) does not require the ``initial_scalars`` argument to be specified.

The tectonic subsidence of each reconstructed geometry point at any reconstruction time can then be queried using
:meth:`pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.get_tectonic_subsidences`:
::

   reconstructed_tectonic_subsidences_in_kms = reconstructed_geometry_time_span.get_tectonic_subsidences(

Deformation

This section covers deformation in pyGPlates.

.. _pygplates_primer_topological_network:

Topological network
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To model deformation, a topological network must first be created. This consists of a boundary polygon
(resolved by intersecting boundary line segments, similar to topological closed plate polygons), optional interior rigid blocks,
individual deforming points, and a triangulation (with vertices from boundary, rigid blocks and deforming points).

.. figure:: images/DeformingNetworkDiagram.png

   On the left are the elements that make up a topological network.
   On the right is the resolving of these elements at a reconstruction time to form a resolved topological network.

More information on topological networks in GPlates/pyGPlates can be found in the following paper:

* Michael Gurnis, Ting Yang, John Cannon, Mark Turner, Simon Williams, Nicolas Flament, R. Dietmar Müller, 2018,

.. _pygplates_primer_rigid_blocks:

Rigid blocks
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A topological network can *optionally* have interior islands that are rigid.

.. note:: Any :meth:`interior geometry of a network <pygplates.GpmlTopologicalSection.create_network_interior>` that is a *polygon* is considered a rigid block.
   And the *interior* rings (if any) of a rigid block polygon are ignored (ie, only the exterior ring applies).

Each rigid block is represented by a :class:`pygplates.ReconstructedFeatureGeometry`, and is obtained from a :class:`pygplates.ResolvedTopologicalNetwork` with:
::

   rigid_blocks = resolved_topological_network.get_rigid_blocks()

For example, you can get the plate ID and boundary polygon of each interior rigid block (if any):
::

  for rigid_block in rigid_blocks:
      rigid_block_plate_id = rigid_block.get_feature().get_reconstruction_plate_id()
      rigid_block_boundary = rigid_block.get_reconstructed_geometry()

.. _pygplates_primer_network_triangulation:

Network triangulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The network triangulation of a :class:`resolved topological network <pygplates.ResolvedTopologicalNetwork>` is the Delaunay triangulation of vertices
obtained from the network's boundary (polygon) and any interior rigid blocks (polygons) and any interior geometries (points or lines).

The Delaunay triangulation is a triangulation of the *convex hull* of its vertices. So it includes triangles *outside* the network boundary
(and also includes triangles *inside* any interior rigid blocks). However, the deforming region of a network is defined to be *inside* the
network's boundary polygon (but *outside* its interior rigid block polygons, if any). Hence the triangulation contains triangles that are *outside*
the deforming region. Therefore each triangle has a :attr:`flag <pygplates.NetworkTriangulation.Triangle.is_in_deforming_region>` indicating whether
it is inside the deforming region (if it's centroid is in the deforming region) or not. These triangles in the deforming region of a network triangulation
are referred to as the *deforming triangulation*.

.. note:: The Delaunay triangulation is not a *constrained* triangulation. This means the edges of some Delaunay triangles can cross over network boundary edges or
   interior block edges, rather than be constrained to follow them. However the flagging of Delaunay triangles (as deforming or non-deforming) deals with this
   quite effectively for current topological network datasets.

The :attr:`deforming <pygplates.NetworkTriangulation.Triangle.is_in_deforming_region>` triangles in a network triangulation do not overlap any
:ref:`interior rigid blocks <pygplates_primer_rigid_blocks>` (other than the above-mentioned note about *constrained* triangulations).
In other words, the *deforming* triangles (in the network triangulation) represent the *deforming* region of a
:class:`resolved topological network <pygplates.ResolvedTopologicalNetwork>` and the rigid blocks (if any) represent the *rigid* regions.

A network triangulation is represented by a :class:`pygplates.NetworkTriangulation`, and is obtained from a :class:`pygplates.ResolvedTopologicalNetwork` with:
::

   network_triangulation = resolved_topological_network.get_network_triangulation()

It consists of a sequence of vertices and a sequence of triangles. Each vertex is represented by a :class:`pygplates.NetworkTriangulation.Vertex` and contains a position,
a velocity, and a strain rate, and a list of incident vertices and incident triangles. Each triangle is represented by a :class:`pygplates.NetworkTriangulation.Triangle`
and contains a flag indicating whether it's deforming or not, and contains a strain rate, and references three vertices and three adjacent triangles.
::

   triangles = network_triangulation.get_triangles()
   vertices = network_triangulation.get_vertices()

   for triangle in triangles:
      triangle_is_in_deforming_region = triangle.is_in_deforming_region
      triangle_strain_rate = triangle.strain_rate

      for index in range(3):
         triangle_vertex = triangle.get_vertex(index)
         adjacent_triangle = triangle.get_adjacent_triangle(index)
         if adjacent_triangle:  # if not at a triangulation boundary
            ...

   for vertex in vertices:
      vertex_position = vertex.position
      vertex_strain_rate = vertex.strain_rate
      vertex_velocity = vertex.get_velocity()  # a function optionally accepting various velocity calculation parameters

      for incident_vertex in vertex.get_incident_vertices():
         ...
      for incident_triangle in vertex.get_incident_triangles():
         ...

.. _pygplates_primer_strain_rates_in_triangulation:

Strain rates in triangulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each :class:`triangle <pygplates.NetworkTriangulation.Triangle>` in a :class:`network triangulation <pygplates.NetworkTriangulation>` is assigned a :class:`strain rate <pygplates.StrainRate>`
that is *constant* across the triangle (and is zero if the triangle is *not* :attr:`deforming <pygplates.NetworkTriangulation.Triangle.is_in_deforming_region>`).
Furthermore, the strain rate of each triangle can optionally be :ref:`clamped to a maximum strain rate <pygplates_primer_strain_rate_clamping>`.
Then each :class:`vertex <pygplates.NetworkTriangulation.Vertex>` in the triangulation is assigned a strain rate that is an area-weighted average of the (potentially clamped) strain rates
from :attr:`deforming <pygplates.NetworkTriangulation.Triangle.is_in_deforming_region>` triangles incident to the vertex.

Finally, the strain rate that is queried at an *arbitrary* location (within the deforming triangulation) is either assigned the strain rate of the triangle containing that location,
or calculated by interpolating the strain rates of nearby vertices if :ref:`strain rates are smoothed <pygplates_primer_strain_rate_smoothing>`.

.. note:: Both strain rate :ref:`clamping <pygplates_primer_strain_rate_clamping>` and :ref:`smoothing <pygplates_primer_strain_rate_smoothing>` affect strain *rate* queries
   (such as :meth:`pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.get_strain_rates`). They also affects *strain* queries (such as :meth:`pygplates.ReconstructedGeometryTimeSpan.get_strains`),
   since strain is :meth:`accumulated <pygplates.Strain.accumulate>` from strain rate.

.. _pygplates_primer_strain_rate_clamping:

Strain rate clamping
""""""""""""""""""""

Strain rates can optionally be clamped to a maximum strain rate to avoid excessive or spurious extension/compression in some triangles of a deforming triangulation.
This can happen in some topological networks depending on how they were built.

It is the :meth:`total strain rate <pygplates.StrainRate.get_total_strain_rate>` that is clamped, since it includes both the normal and shear components of deformation.
When a strain rate is clamped, all components of its tensor (specifically its :class:`spatial gradients of velocity tensor <pygplates.StrainRate.get_velocity_spatial_gradient>`)
are scaled equally to ensure its total strain rate equals the maximum total strain rate.

.. note:: Clamping the total strain rate also limits quantities derived from strain rate such as crustal thinning and tectonic subsidence.

Strain rate clamping is determined by :attr:`pygplates.ResolveTopologyParameters.enable_strain_rate_clamping` when topological networks are resolved at a reconstruction time
(using :class:`pygplates.TopologicalModel`, :class:`pygplates.TopologicalSnapshot` or :func:`pygplates.resolve_topologies`).
And the maximum strain rate is :attr:`pygplates.ResolveTopologyParameters.max_clamped_strain_rate`.
For example, to enable strain rate clamping (which is disabled by default) for a topological model, but keep the default maximum strain rate:
::

   topological_model = pygplates.TopologicalModel(
      'topologies.gpml',
      'rotations.rot',
      default_resolve_topology_parameters = pygplates.ResolveTopologyParameters(
         enable_strain_rate_clamping = True))

.. _pygplates_primer_strain_rate_smoothing:

Strain rate smoothing
"""""""""""""""""""""

Strain rates can optionally be smoothed to help reduce the faceted (piecewise constant) strain rate across a deforming triangulation (due to each triangle having a *constant* strain rate across its face).

.. note:: Smoothing the strain rate also affects quantities derived from strain rate such as crustal thinning and tectonic subsidence.

The strain rate at an arbitrary location within a deforming triangulation is affected by the smoothing value:

* ``pygplates.StrainRateSmoothing.none`` - No smoothing. The strain rate is equal to the (constant) strain rate of the :class:`triangle <pygplates.NetworkTriangulation.Triangle>` containing the query location.
* ``pygplates.StrainRateSmoothing.barycentric`` - Use linear interpolation of the strain rates of the 3 :class:`vertices <pygplates.NetworkTriangulation.Vertex>` of the
  :class:`triangle <pygplates.NetworkTriangulation.Triangle>` containing the query location.
* ``pygplates.StrainRateSmoothing.natural_neighbour`` - Use natural neighbour interpolation of the strain rates of triangulation :class:`vertices <pygplates.NetworkTriangulation.Vertex>` near the query location.

Strain rate smoothing is determined by :attr:`pygplates.ResolveTopologyParameters.strain_rate_smoothing` when topological networks are resolved at a reconstruction time
(using :class:`pygplates.TopologicalModel`, :class:`pygplates.TopologicalSnapshot` or :func:`pygplates.resolve_topologies`).
For example, to disable strain rate smoothing (which is natural neighbour smoothing by default) for a topological model:
::

   topological_model = pygplates.TopologicalModel(
      'topologies.gpml',
      'rotations.rot',
      default_resolve_topology_parameters = pygplates.ResolveTopologyParameters(
         strain_rate_smoothing = pygplates.StrainRateSmoothing.none))

Exponential rift stretching profile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A rift is typically modeled using two topological networks, one on each side of the rift axis. Each side of the rift axis typically has a single row of triangles (between the un-stretched side and the rift axis).
As a result, the strain rate at any location within the rift will essentially be *constant*, even when the :ref:`strain rates are smoothed <pygplates_primer_strain_rate_smoothing>`.
This is because triangulation vertices, along both the un-stretched boundary line and the rift axis, will effectively end up with the strain rate of the triangles (which is constant across each triangle).

To avoid the problem of *constant* stretching across the rift, an *exponential* rift stretching profile can be activated by adding rift left/right plate ID properties to a topological network feature.

Internally the exponential strain rate profile is implemented by automatically adding more points to the interior of a deforming triangulation and distributing the velocities
at these points such that the strain rate varies exponentially (along the stretching direction) from the un-stretched side of the rift towards the rift axis.

.. note:: This works reasonably well for regular rifts (like AFR-SAM), but not as well for oblique rifts (like AUS-ANT).

.. note:: The exponential rift stretching profile affects quantities derived from strain rate such as crustal thinning and tectonic subsidence.

Rift left/right plate IDs
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

An *exponential* rift stretching profile is activated by adding a ``gpml:riftLeftPlate``/``gpml:riftRightPlate`` pair of conjugate plate ID properties to a topological network :class:`pygplates.Feature`.
This can be done, for example, by using the *rift_parameters* argument of :meth:`pygplates.Feature.create_topological_network_feature`.
The presence of these plate IDs triggers the internal generation of an exponential strain rate rift profile when the topological networks are resolved at a reconstruction time
(using :class:`pygplates.TopologicalModel`, :class:`pygplates.TopologicalSnapshot` or :func:`pygplates.resolve_topologies`).

For example, to create a rift between Africa and South America:
::

  SAM_rift_network = pygplates.GpmlTopologicalNetwork([...])
  SAM_rift_feature = pygplates.Feature.create_topological_network_feature(
      SAM_rift_network,
      name='SAM rift',
      valid_time=(145, 115),
      rift_parameters=(201, 701))
  SAM_rift_feature.set_reconstruction_plate_id(201)

  AFR_rift_network = pygplates.GpmlTopologicalNetwork([...])
  AFR_rift_feature = pygplates.Feature.create_topological_network_feature(
      AFR_rift_network,
      name='AFR rift',
      valid_time=(145, 115),
      rift_parameters=(201, 701))
  AFR_rift_feature.set_reconstruction_plate_id(701)

.. note:: If the rift left/right plate ID properties are not present in a topological network feature then it is *not* considered a *rift*.

There are also three other parameters, in addition to the rift left/right plate IDs, that are optional and can either be set individually in each a topological network feature
(eg, using the *rift_parameters* argument of :meth:`pygplates.Feature.create_topological_network_feature`) or as default values for all topological network features
(using :class:`pygplates.ResolveTopologyParameters`).

.. note:: If these parameters are set in both places, then the feature properties have precedence.

When set on a topological network feature they become feature properties named:

* ``gpml:riftExponentialStretchingConstant``
* ``gpml:riftStrainRateResolutionLog10`` (note that this is :math:`\log_{10}` of the rift strain rate resolution)
* ``gpml:riftEdgeLengthThresholdDegrees``

...and for features missing these properties these parameters are instead obtained from :class:`pygplates.ResolveTopologyParameters` attributes:

* :attr:`pygplates.ResolveTopologyParameters.rift_exponential_stretching_constant`
* :attr:`pygplates.ResolveTopologyParameters.rift_strain_rate_resolution`
* :attr:`pygplates.ResolveTopologyParameters.rift_edge_length_threshold_degrees`

...when the topological networks are resolved at a reconstruction time
(using :class:`pygplates.TopologicalModel`, :class:`pygplates.TopologicalSnapshot` or :func:`pygplates.resolve_topologies`).

The default values (in :meth:`pygplates.ResolveTopologyParameters() <pygplates.ResolveTopologyParameters.__init__>`) should be fine
for resolving rift features that do not contain the associated rift feature properties. But you can change the defaults as needed.
For example, new default values can be specified for a topological model:
::

   topological_model = pygplates.TopologicalModel(
      'topologies.gpml',
      'rotations.rot',
      default_resolve_topology_parameters = pygplates.ResolveTopologyParameters(
         rift_exponential_stretching_constant = 1.5,  # default is 1.0
         rift_strain_rate_resolution = 1e-16,         # default is 5e-17
         rift_edge_length_threshold_degrees = 0.2))   # default is 0.1

Rift exponential stretching constant
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The strain rate in the rift stretching direction varies exponentially from the un-stretched side of the rift towards the rift axis.
The spatial variation in strain rate is:

  .. math::

     strain\_rate(x) = strain\_rate \times e^{C x} \frac{C}{e^C - 1}

...where :math:`strain\_rate` is the un-subdivided, original (constant) strain rate, :math:`C` is the *rift exponential stretching constant*
and :math:`x = 0` at the un-stretched side and :math:`x = 1` at the stretched point. Therefore :math:`strain\_rate(0) < strain\_rate < strain\_rate(1)`.
For example, when :math:`C = 1.0` then :math:`strain\_rate(0) = 0.58 \times strain\_rate` and :math:`strain\_rate(1) = 1.58 \times strain\_rate`.

Rift strain rate resolution
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The *rift strain rate resolution* controls how accurately the actual strain rate curve (across rift profile) matches the exponential curve (in units of :math:`second^{-1}`).
Rift edges in the network triangulation are sub-divided until the strain rate matches the exponential curve (within this tolerance).

Rift edge length threshold
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Rift edges in network triangulation shorter than the *rift edge length threshold* (in degrees) will not be further sub-divided.
