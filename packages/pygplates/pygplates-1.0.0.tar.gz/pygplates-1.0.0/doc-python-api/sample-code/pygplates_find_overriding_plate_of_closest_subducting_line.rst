Find overriding plate of closest subducting line
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This example finds the overriding plate of the nearest subducting line over time by:

- reconstructing regular features,
- resolving topological plate boundaries,
- finding the nearest subducting line (in the topological plate boundaries) to each regular feature,
- determining the overriding plate of that subducting line.
