Reconstruct regular features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| This example shows a couple of different scenarios involving the reconstruction of *regular* features to geological times.
| Regular features exclude `topological <http://www.gplates.org/docs/gpgim/#gpml:TopologicalFeature>`_ features,
  `motion path <http://www.gplates.org/docs/gpgim/#gpml:MotionPath>`_ features and
  `flowline <http://www.gplates.org/docs/gpgim/#gpml:Flowline>`_ features.

.. _pygplates_export_reconstructed_features_to_a_file:

Exported reconstructed features to a file
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this example we reconstruct regular features and export the results to a Shapefile.

Calculate distance a feature is reconstructed

In this example we calculate the distance between a feature geometry's present day (centroid) location
