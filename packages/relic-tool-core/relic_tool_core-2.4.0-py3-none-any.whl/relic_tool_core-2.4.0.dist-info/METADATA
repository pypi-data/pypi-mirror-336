### Description
The core library used by other Relic-Tool packages.

------

## Usage
### From the Command Line Interface
While the core library does not define any commands; it does define the command line. To discover installed commands, run the following.

```console
relic -h
```

### From Python Code
Commands can also be run directly from the library; To discover installed commands, run the following.
```python
from relic.core import CLI

exit_status = CLI.run_with('-h')
```
### Troubleshooting
#### No Commands are installed!
The core package does not define any CLI functionality itself.

If no options are specified, check to see if other Relic-Tool packages are installed that offer command line integration.

You can do this by running the following:
```console
python -m pip list
```
And looking for `relic-tool-...` in the command's output.

If you only see `relic-tool-core`, you need to install the desired Relic-Tool package the command belongs to.
