              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

# OWPHydroTools :: Events

This subpackage implements methods to partition hydrometric times series into discrete "events." See the [Events Documentation](https://noaa-owp.github.io/hydrotools/hydrotools.events.event_detection.html) for a complete list and description of the currently available methods. To report bugs or request new methods, submit an issue through the [OWPHydroTools Issue Tracker](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/hydrotools/issues) on GitHub.

## Installation

In accordance with the python community, we support and advise the usage of virtual
environments in any workflow using python. In the following installation guide, we
use python's built-in `venv` module to create a virtual environment in which the
tool will be installed. Note this is just personal preference, any python virtual
environment manager should work just fine (`conda`, `pipenv`, etc. ).

```bash
# Create and activate python environment, requires python >= 3.8
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install events
$ python3 -m pip install hydrotools.events
```

## Event Detection Usage

The following example demonstrates how one might use `hydrotools.events.event_detection` to extract hydrological events from a time series of real streamflow measurements. This example requires the `hydrotools.nwis_client` package.

### Code
```python
# Import tools to retrieve data and detect events
from hydrotools.nwis_client.iv import IVDataService
from hydrotools.events.event_detection import decomposition as ev

# Use pandas to resample the data
from pandas import Grouper

# Use a helper function to detect events at multiple sites
def list_events_helper(mi_series, level, halflife, window):
    """Reduce multi-index series before applying event detection."""
    return ev.list_events(mi_series.droplevel(level), halflife, window)

# Retrieve streamflow observations for two sites
service = IVDataService()
observations = service.get(
    sites='02146750,0214676115,09489000', 
    startDT='2019-10-01', 
    endDT='2020-09-30'
    )

# Drop extra columns to be more efficient
observations = observations[[
    'usgs_site_code', 
    'value_date', 
    'value'
    ]]

# Check for duplicate time series, keep first by default
observations = observations.drop_duplicates(
    subset=['usgs_site_code', 'value_date']
    )

# Resample to hourly, keep first measurement in each 1-hour bin
observations = observations.groupby([
    'usgs_site_code',
    Grouper(key='value_date', freq='h')
    ]).first().ffill()

# Detect events
events = observations['value'].groupby(
    level='usgs_site_code').apply(
        list_events_helper, 
        level='usgs_site_code', 
        halflife='6h', 
        window='7D'
    )

# Print event list    
print(events)
```

### Output
```console
                                start                 end

### Event Detection Tips
The `evaluation_tools.events.event_detection.decomposition` method has two main parameters: `halflife` and `window`. These parameters are passed directly to underlying filters used to remove noise and model the trend in a streamflow time series (also called *baseflow*). Significant contiguous deviations from this trend are flagged as "events". This method was originally conceived to detect rainfall-driven runoff events in small watersheds from records of volumetric discharge or total runoff. Before using decomposition you will want to have some idea of the event timescales you hope to detect.

In general you'll want to consider the following:

1. Ensure your time series is monotonically increasing with a frequency significantly less than the frequency of events and fill missing data
2. Use a `pandas.Timedelta` compatible `str` to specify `halflife` and `window`. See the [pandas docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Timedelta.html)
3. Specify a `halflife` larger than the expected frequency of noise, but smaller than the event timescale
4. Specify a `window` larger than the event timescale, but at least 4 to 5 times smaller than the entire length of the time series
5. Filter the final list of events to remove false positive events, particularly in noisy signals. You could filter on peak event flow, event duration, or other event characteristics

## Baseflow Separation Usage

![Baseflow Hydrograph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-OWP/hydrotools/main/docs/baseflow_hydrograph.png)

The following example demonstrates how to use `hydrotools.events.baseflow` to estimate baseflow from a time series of streamflow values. This example requires the `hydrotools.nwis_client` package.

### Code
```python
# Import tools to retrieve data and perform baseflow separation
from hydrotools.events.baseflow import eckhardt as bf
from hydrotools.nwis_client.iv import IVDataService

# Get some streamflow data
client = IVDataService()
df = client.get(
    startDT="2020-10-01",
    endDT="2021-09-30T23:55",
    sites="02146470"
)

# Important: Streamflow data should be continuous with
#   no missing data and a DateTimeIndex
TIME_SCALE = "1h"
df = df.set_index("value_time").resample(TIME_SCALE).first().ffill()

# Let's rename 'value' to 'total_flow'
df = df.rename(columns={"value": "total_flow"})

# Perform baseflow separation
#   This catchment is pretty small, so we'll use a
#   12-hour recession time-scale. The default is 1-day
#   per Eckhardt (2008).
results = bf.separate_baseflow(
    df["total_flow"],
    output_time_scale = TIME_SCALE,
    recession_time_scale = "12h"
    )

# Look at the 12-hour filter parameters
print(f"Recession constant, a: {results.recession_constant:.4f}")
print(f"Maximum baseflow index, bfi_max: {results.maximum_baseflow_index:.4f}")

# Store the resulting baseflow in the original DataFrame
df["baseflow"] = results.values
print(df.head())
```

### Output
```console

## Interception

The `hydrotools.events.models.interception` module includes a basic method that estimates canopy interception. The method includes reasonable defaults from the literature for average evaporation rates and trunk fractions. The primary point of entry is the `compute_interception` method which estimates canopy intercepted rainfall in units of depth. `compute_interception` requires a gross rainfall amount, an average rain rate, and a canopy fraction. The defaults assume that gross rainfall is in mm, rainfall rate is in mm/h, and canopy fraction is dimensionless. While this method can be used in different contexts, expected usage is for event-scale (single storm) catchment-wide estimates of intercepted rainfall.

### Example usage

```python
# Imports
from hydrotools.events.models.interception import compute_interception

# Assumed values for a single event
storm_total_rainfall = 50.0 # mm
mean_rainfall_rate = 5.0 # mm/h
vegetative_fraction = 0.5 # 50% vegetative landcover

# Estimate interception
estimate = compute_interception(
    gross_rainfall = storm_total_rainfall,
    rainfall_rate = mean_rainfall_rate,
    canopy_fraction = vegetative_fraction
)
print(f"Storm total intercepted rainfall (mm): {estimate:.1f}")
print(f"Storm total intercepted rainfall (%): {(estimate/storm_total_rainfall)*100:.1f}")
print(f"Effective rainfall (mm): {storm_total_rainfall-estimate:.1f}")
```

### Output
```console
Storm total intercepted rainfall (mm): 2.5
Storm total intercepted rainfall (%): 5.0
Effective rainfall (mm): 47.5
```
