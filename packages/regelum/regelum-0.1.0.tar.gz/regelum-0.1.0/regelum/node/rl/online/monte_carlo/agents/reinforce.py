"""REINFORCE (Monte Carlo Policy Gradient) agent implementation.

This module implements the REINFORCE algorithm, a Monte Carlo policy gradient method
for reinforcement learning. The agent learns by sampling complete episodes and updating
its policy parameters using the accumulated rewards. It is a fundamental policy gradient
method that forms the basis for many modern policy optimization algorithms.
