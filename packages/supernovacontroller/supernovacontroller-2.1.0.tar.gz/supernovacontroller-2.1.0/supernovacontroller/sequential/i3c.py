        """
        Performs a broadcast ENTAS0 (Enter Activity State 0) operation on the I3C bus.

        This method sends a broadcast command to inform all devices on the I3C bus to enter Activity State 0,
        where the bus is expected to be idle for 1 microsecond (us). It is part of an activity state series
        (ENTAS0 to ENTAS3) that devices can use for power management, specifically to manage low power states during idle periods.

        The ENTAS0 command acts as a suggestion rather than a directive, allowing devices to prepare for a
        low-power state without overriding any specific or custom power-saving agreements that might be
        implemented at the application level.

        Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing two elements:
            - The first element is a Boolean indicating the success (True) or failure (False) of the operation.
            - The second element is either an error message detailing the failure or a success message,
              reflecting the broadcast command's attempt to set the bus to the specified idle time.
