class SupernovaI2CBlockingInterface:
    """
    The SupernovaI2CBlockingInterface class provides methods to interact with I2C devices.

    This class includes three primary methods:

    - write(target_static_address, register_address, data):
        Writes data to the specified I2C target device.

    - read(target_static_address, length):
        Reads data from the specified I2C target device.

    - read_from(target_static_address, register_address, length):
        Reads data from the specified I2C target device, indicating the address of the internal register from which the data is read.

    Clarification on I2C Interface:

    The signature of the I2C interface methods (i.e., write, read, and read_from) is as follows:

    i2c.write(target_static_address, register_address, data):
        - target_static_address: This is the static address of the I2C target.
        - register_address: A Python list representing the register address of the I2C target.
          This value is optional because it depends on the target. Most I2C targets provide a memory register map so the
          I2C controller can access and write to or read from the memory by indexing it with a register address. However,
          some I2C targets receive bytes that are interpreted as commands. If the internal register is not used, the
          register address list can be left empty. For example: i2c.write(0x18, [], [0xF1, 0xF2, 0xF3, 0xF4, 0xF5]).
          The maximum length of the register address list is 4. For example: i2c.write(0x18, [0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04],
          [0xF1, 0xF2, 0xF3, 0xF4, 0xF5]).
        - data: A Python list of bytes holding the data to be sent over I2C. The maximum length is 1024 bytes.

        When passing both lists (register_address and data) populated with data, the stream of bytes transferred over
        I2C is the addition of both lists. For instance, when sending the command i2c.write(0x18, [0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04],
        [0xF1, 0xF2, 0xF3, 0xF4, 0xF5]), the expected result on the bus is: START + TARGET_ADDRESS/W + 0x01 + 0x02 + 0x03
        + 0x04 + 0xF1 + 0xF2 + 0xF3 + 0xF4 + 0xF5 + STOP.

    i2c.read(target_static_address, length):
        - target_static_address: This is the static address of the I2C target.
        - length: The number of bytes to be read from the target.

        Reads data from the I2C target device without specifying a register address.

    i2c.read_from(target_static_address, register_address, length):
        - target_static_address: This is the static address of the I2C target.
        - register_address: A Python list representing the register address of the internal memory of the I2C target.
          This value is optional and depends on the target. The maximum length of the register address list is 4.
        - length: The number of bytes to be read from the target.

        The length parameter specifies the number of bytes to be read from the target.

    Important Note:
    ---------------
    - When writing to an I2C target that uses an internal memory register map, ensure that the register address length
      is consistent with the target's requirements. For example, some targets may use 1 byte for the register address,
      while others may use 2 or more bytes.

    def read_from(self, address, register, length):
        """
        Performs a read operation from a specific register of an I2C device.

        This method reads data from a specified register of a device at a given I2C address.
        The number of bytes to read is also specified. Before performing the read operation,
        the method checks if the bus voltage is initialized. If the bus is not initialized
        (i.e., bus voltage is None), it raises an error. The success or failure of the read
        operation, along with the data read, is determined based on the response from the hardware.

        Args:
        address (int): The I2C address of the device to read from.
        register (int): The register address within the device from which to read.
        length (int): The number of bytes to read from the specified register.

        Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing two elements:
            - The first element is a Boolean indicating the success (True) or failure (False)
              of the read operation.
            - The second element is the data read in bytes if the operation is successful,
            or None in case of failure.

        Note:
        - It is important to ensure that the bus voltage is correctly set before attempting a read operation,
          as the correct voltage is essential for proper I2C communication.
        - The method does not perform any validation on the input parameters (address, register, length). Users
          should ensure these parameters are correct and within the acceptable range for the intended device.
