Additional features
-------------------

Related to 21-cm signal computation, ``ECHO21`` can be used to calculate Ly :math:`\alpha` coupling and SFRD. Further, ``ECHO21`` can be utilized to generate the reionization history and also the CMB optical depth. The best way to see this in action is to look at the jupyter notebook in the example folder.
