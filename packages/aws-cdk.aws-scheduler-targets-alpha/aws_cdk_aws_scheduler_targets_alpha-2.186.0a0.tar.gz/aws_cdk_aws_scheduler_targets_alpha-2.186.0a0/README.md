[Amazon EventBridge Scheduler](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-amazon-eventbridge-scheduler/) is a feature from Amazon EventBridge
that allows you to create, run, and manage scheduled tasks at scale. With EventBridge Scheduler, you can schedule millions of one-time or recurring tasks across various AWS services without provisioning or managing underlying infrastructure.

This library contains integration classes for Amazon EventBridge Scheduler to call any
number of supported AWS Services.

The following targets are supported:

1. `targets.LambdaInvoke`: [Invoke an AWS Lambda function](#invoke-a-lambda-function)
2. `targets.StepFunctionsStartExecution`: [Start an AWS Step Function](#start-an-aws-step-function)
3. `targets.CodeBuildStartBuild`: [Start a CodeBuild job](#start-a-codebuild-job)
4. `targets.SqsSendMessage`: [Send a Message to an Amazon SQS Queue](#send-a-message-to-an-sqs-queue)
5. `targets.SnsPublish`: [Publish messages to an Amazon SNS topic](#publish-messages-to-an-amazon-sns-topic)
6. `targets.EventBridgePutEvents`: [Put Events on EventBridge](#send-events-to-an-eventbridge-event-bus)
7. `targets.InspectorStartAssessmentRun`: [Start an Amazon Inspector assessment run](#start-an-amazon-inspector-assessment-run)
8. `targets.KinesisStreamPutRecord`: [Put a record to an Amazon Kinesis Data Stream](#put-a-record-to-an-amazon-kinesis-data-stream)
9. `targets.FirehosePutRecord`: [Put a record to an Amazon Data Firehose](#put-a-record-to-an-amazon-data-firehose)
10. `targets.CodePipelineStartPipelineExecution`: [Start a CodePipeline execution](#start-a-codepipeline-execution)
11. `targets.SageMakerStartPipelineExecution`: [Start a SageMaker pipeline execution](#start-a-sagemaker-pipeline-execution)
12. `targets.EcsRunTask`: [Start a new ECS task](#schedule-an-ecs-task-run)
13. `targets.Universal`: [Invoke a wider set of AWS API](#invoke-a-wider-set-of-aws-api)

## Invoke a Lambda function

Use the `LambdaInvoke` target to invoke a lambda function.

The code snippet below creates an event rule with a Lambda function as a target
called every hour by EventBridge Scheduler with a custom payload. You can optionally attach a
[dead letter queue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/rule-dlq.html).

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_lambda as lambda_


fn = lambda_.Function(self, "MyFunc",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_LATEST,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_inline("exports.handler = handler.toString()")
)

dlq = sqs.Queue(self, "DLQ",
    queue_name="MyDLQ"
)

target = targets.LambdaInvoke(fn,
    dead_letter_queue=dlq,
    max_event_age=Duration.minutes(1),
    retry_attempts=3,
    input=ScheduleTargetInput.from_object({
        "payload": "useful"
    })
)

schedule = Schedule(self, "Schedule",
    schedule=ScheduleExpression.rate(Duration.hours(1)),
    target=target
)
```

payload = {
    "Name": "MyParameter",
    "Value": "üå•Ô∏è"
}

put_parameter_step = tasks.CallAwsService(self, "PutParameter",
    service="ssm",
    action="putParameter",
    iam_resources=["*"],
    parameters={
        "Name.$": "$.Name",
        "Value.$": "$.Value",
        "Type": "String",
        "Overwrite": True
    }
)

Schedule(self, "Schedule",
    schedule=ScheduleExpression.rate(Duration.hours(1)),
    target=targets.StepFunctionsStartExecution(state_machine,
        input=ScheduleTargetInput.from_object(payload)
    )
)
```

## Start a CodeBuild job

Use the `CodeBuildStartBuild` target to start a new build run on a CodeBuild project.

```

## Send a Message To an SQS Queue

Use the `SqsSendMessage` target to send a message to an SQS Queue.

The code snippet below creates an event rule with an SQS Queue as a target
called every hour by EventBridge Scheduler with a custom payload.

Contains the `messageGroupId` to use when the target is a FIFO queue. If you specify
a FIFO queue as a target, the queue must have content-based deduplication enabled.

```python
payload = "test"
message_group_id = "id"
queue = sqs.Queue(self, "MyQueue",
    fifo=True,
    content_based_deduplication=True
)

target = targets.SqsSendMessage(queue,
    input=ScheduleTargetInput.from_text(payload),
    message_group_id=message_group_id
)

Schedule(self, "Schedule",
    schedule=ScheduleExpression.rate(Duration.minutes(1)),
    target=target
)
```

## Publish messages to an Amazon SNS topic

Use the `SnsPublish` target to publish messages to an Amazon SNS topic.

event_bus = events.EventBus(self, "EventBus",
    event_bus_name="DomainEvents"
)

event_entry = targets.EventBridgePutEventsEntry(
    event_bus=event_bus,
    source="PetService",
    detail=ScheduleTargetInput.from_object({"Name": "Fluffy"}),
    detail_type="üê∂"
)

Schedule(self, "Schedule",
    schedule=ScheduleExpression.rate(Duration.hours(1)),
    target=targets.EventBridgePutEvents(event_entry)
)
```

## Start an Amazon Inspector assessment run

    schedule=ScheduleExpression.rate(Duration.minutes(60)),
    target=targets.KinesisStreamPutRecord(stream,
        partition_key="key"
    )
)
```

## Put a record to an Amazon Data Firehose

            value="parameter-value"
        )]
    )
)
```

## Schedule an ECS task run

Use the `EcsRunTask` target to schedule an ECS task run for a cluster.

The code snippet below creates an event rule with a Fargate task definition and cluster as the target which is called every hour by EventBridge Scheduler.

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_ecs as ecs

# cluster: ecs.ICluster
# task_definition: ecs.FargateTaskDefinition


Schedule(self, "Schedule",
    schedule=ScheduleExpression.rate(cdk.Duration.minutes(60)),

    target=targets.EcsRunEc2Task(cluster,
        task_definition=task_definition
    )
)
```

## Invoke a wider set of AWS API

Use the `Universal` target to invoke AWS API. See [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/scheduler/latest/UserGuide/managing-targets-universal.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/scheduler/latest/UserGuide/managing-targets-universal.html)

The code snippet below creates an event rule with AWS API as the target which is
called at midnight every day by EventBridge Scheduler.

```python
Schedule(self, "Schedule",
    schedule=ScheduleExpression.cron(
        minute="0",
        hour="0"
    ),
    target=targets.Universal(
        service="rds",
        action="stopDBCluster",
        input=ScheduleTargetInput.from_object({
            "DbClusterIdentifier": "my-db"
        })
    )
)
```

The `service` must be in lowercase and the `action` must be in camelCase.

By default, an IAM policy for the Scheduler is extracted from the API call. The action in the policy is constructed using the `service` and `action` prop.
Re-using the example above, the action will be `rds:stopDBCluster`. Note that not all IAM actions follow the same pattern. In such scenario, please use the
`policyStatements` prop to override the policy:

```python
Schedule(self, "Schedule",
    schedule=ScheduleExpression.rate(Duration.minutes(60)),
    target=targets.Universal(
        service="sqs",
        action="sendMessage",
        policy_statements=[
            iam.PolicyStatement(
                actions=["sqs:SendMessage"],
                resources=["arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:123456789012:my_queue"]
            ),
            iam.PolicyStatement(
                actions=["kms:Decrypt", "kms:GenerateDataKey*"],
                resources=["arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/0987dcba-09fe-87dc-65ba-ab0987654321"]
            )
        ]
    )
)
```

> Note: The default policy uses `*` in the resources field as CDK does not have a straight forward way to auto-discover the resources permission required.
> It is recommended that you scope the field down to specific resources to have a better security posture.
