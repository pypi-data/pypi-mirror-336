# This workflow runs automated tests and quality checks on the codebase
name: CI

# Trigger the workflow on push and pull request events, but only for the dev branch
on:
    push:
        branches: [dev]
    pull_request:
        branches: [dev]

jobs:
    # Main test job that runs the test suite across multiple Python versions
    test:
        # Use latest Ubuntu runner for testing
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
