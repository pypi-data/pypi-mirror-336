class NearWell:
    """
    This class defines a link between a section in DWell and a boundary/grid block in a reservoir model. DWell delivers
    boundary conditions to the reservoir model, and the injection into (or production from) the reservoir is received
    by DWell from the reservoir model as mass rate for each phase.

    Applications: The link provides coupled transient simulation of near-wellbore reservoir flow and well flow.
    Dynamic phenomena not accurately predicted or even not seen with the steady-state inflow performance relationship
    model may therefore be simulated in a more realistic way. Typical examples are well shut-in and start-up, dynamic
    gas and water coning, cross-flow between layers, etc.

    Note: There is no automatic check of the correspondence in positioning and size between segments in DWell and
    boundary grid blocks in the reservoir simulators. You must therefore discretize both grids in such a way that this
    is satisfied.
