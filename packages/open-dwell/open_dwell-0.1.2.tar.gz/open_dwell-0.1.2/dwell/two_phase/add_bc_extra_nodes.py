"""
Using the classes defined in this module, you can define nodes and node-type equipment in the flow network system.
The difference between these nodes and sources/sinks defined in add_bc_sources_sinks.py is that these nodes
have their own residual equations in order to be defined.

The different between nodes and extra nodes is that nodes are specified on the current segments of the pipe, and so
the residual equation of the segment will be replaced with the new residual equation of the boundary condition. On the
other hand, for extra nodes, an extra node will be connected to the current intended segment of the pipe, and a residual
equation will be written for the new node, so in this case, the total number of residual equations increases.
