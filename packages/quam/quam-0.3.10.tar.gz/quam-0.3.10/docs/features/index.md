# QuAM Features

The features section of the Quantum Abstract Machine (QuAM) documentation highlights the unique capabilities and functionalities that enhance the usability and performance of the QuAM framework. Here, you will find detailed explanations and examples of how to leverage these features in your quantum projects.

## QuAM Referencing
QuAM referencing is a sophisticated feature designed to streamline the management and modification of quantum configurations. It allows users to define relationships and dependencies between various components within a QuAM setup, facilitating easier updates and scalability.

- **[QuAM Referencing Documentation](quam-references.md)**: Learn about the syntax and usage of QuAMâ€™s powerful referencing system. This feature simplifies the process of modifying and scaling quantum experiments by allowing users to reference previously defined elements, parameters, and configurations, thus avoiding redundancy and reducing the potential for errors.

This section of the documentation provides insights into the foundational features that make QuAM a robust and adaptable framework for quantum computing. Explore the detailed documentation to fully utilize these features in your work.
