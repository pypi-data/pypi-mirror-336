# QuAM Components

The components section of the Quantum Abstract Machine (QuAM) documentation outlines the modular parts of the QuAM framework, each designed to enable flexible and efficient quantum programming. Below, you'll find an overview of the main components that you can utilize and extend in your quantum projects.

## Channels
Channels are fundamental building blocks in QuAM that facilitate the routing of quantum signals to various hardware components. They serve as the conduits for pulses and other quantum operations, translating abstract quantum actions into physical outcomes on a quantum processor.

- **[Channels Documentation](channels.md)**: Explore the detailed documentation on different types of channels including IQ Channels, Single Analog Output Channels, and more.

## Pulses
Pulses in QuAM are used to manipulate qubit states through precise control over their quantum properties. These are defined with specific parameters like amplitude, duration, and waveform, allowing detailed control over quantum operations.

- **[Pulses Documentation](pulses.md)**: Learn how to define and use different types of pulses such as Gaussian, Square, and DRAG pulses in your quantum circuits.

## Octave
The Octave component in QuAM handles the upconversion and downconversion of frequencies, enabling high-fidelity signal processing for quantum experiments. This is particularly important for setups requiring complex signal manipulations across multiple frequency bands.

## Custom QuAM Components
For users looking to expand beyond the standard QuAM toolkit, custom components provide a way to introduce novel functionalities tailored to specific quantum computing needs or experimental setups.
