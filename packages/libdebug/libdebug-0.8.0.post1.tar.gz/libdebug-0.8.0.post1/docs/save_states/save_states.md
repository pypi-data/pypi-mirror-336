# :material-database: Save States
Save states are a powerful feature in **libdebug** to save the current state of the process.

There is no single way to define a save state. The state of a process in an operating system, is _not just its memory and register contents_. The process interacts with _shared external resources_, such as files, sockets, and other processes. These resources cannot be restored in a reliable way. Still, there are many interesting use cases for saving and restoring all that can be saved.

So...what is a save state in **libdebug**? Although we plan on supporting multiple types of save states for different use cases in the near future, **libdebug** currently supports only [snapshots](../snapshots).
