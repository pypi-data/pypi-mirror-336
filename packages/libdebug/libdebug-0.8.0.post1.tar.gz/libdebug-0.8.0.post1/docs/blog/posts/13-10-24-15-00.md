# A New Documentation
Hello, World! Thank for using **libdebug**. We are proud to roll out our new documentation along with version 0.7.0. This new documentation is powered by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). We hope you find it more intuitive and easier to navigate.

We have expanded the documentation to cover more topics and provide more examples. We also tried to highlight some common difficulties that have been reported. Also, thanks to the mkdocs search plugin, you can more easily find what you are looking for, both in the documentation and pages generated from Pydoc.

We hope you enjoy the new documentation. If you find any mistakes or would like to suggest improvements, please let us know by opening an :octicons-issue-opened-24: issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/libdebug/libdebug/issues).
