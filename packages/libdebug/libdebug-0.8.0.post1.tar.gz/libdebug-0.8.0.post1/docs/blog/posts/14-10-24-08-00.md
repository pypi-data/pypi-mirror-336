# See you at ACM CCS 2024!
We are excited to announce that we will be presenting a poster on **libdebug** at the 2024 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS 2024). The conference will be held in Salt Lake City, Utah. The poster session is October 16th at 16:30. We will be presenting the rationale behind **libdebug** and demonstrating how it can be used in some cool use cases.

If you are attending the conference, please stop by our poster and say hello. We would love to meet you and hear about your ideas. We are also looking forward to hearing about your research and how **libdebug** can help you in your work. Come by and grab some swag!
