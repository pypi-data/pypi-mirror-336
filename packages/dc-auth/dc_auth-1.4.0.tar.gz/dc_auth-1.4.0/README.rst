=======

dc-auth is a dedicated Django app to connect the Data Central authentication
service provided by CAS.

dc-auth also provides base templates and other core django support that Data
Central django apps can use.

For users outside of Data Central, you'll need to send us details about your
application in order to be able to connect, please contact us at
https://jira.aao.org.au/servicedesk/customer/portal/3.

See the docs at https://datacentral.survey.org.au/common/dc_auth/ for more details.
