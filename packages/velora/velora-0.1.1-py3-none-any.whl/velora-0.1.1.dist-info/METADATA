# Velora

**Velora** is a lightweight and extensible framework built on top of powerful libraries like [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), specializing in a unique approach to Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms, a paradigm we call *Liquid RL*.

Instead of Fully-connected Networks, Velora combines [Liquid Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04439) (LNNs) with [Neural Circuit Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08554) (NCPs), specifically [Ordinary Neural Circuits](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/hasani20a.html) (ONCs).

These two components have interesting benefits:

- LNNs are a powerful RNN architecture that learns system dynamics, not just data patterns.
- NCPs focus on sparsely connected neurons with distinct functions, mimicking biological behaviour.

From what we've seen, these networks are powerful, small-scale architectures that excel in model explainability, making them perfect for control tasks.

Velora offers Liquidfied PyTorch-based implementations of RL algorithms, designed to be intuitive, easy to use, and customizable.

In other frameworks, we've seen a trend of heavy abstraction in favour of minimal lines of code. Our approach aims to offer a best of both worlds, abstracting code away but making the details explainable on the backend, while giving you the freedom to customize as needed.

## Installation

To get started, simply install it through [pip](https://pypi.org/) using one of the options below.

### GPU Enabled

For [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) with CUDA (recommended):

```bash
pip install torch torchvision velora --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```

### CPU Only

Or, for [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) with CPU only:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision velora
```

## Example Usage

Here's a simple example that should work 'as is':

```python
from functools import partial

from velora.models import LiquidDDPG
from velora.gym import wrap_gym_env
from velora.utils import set_device, set_seed

import gymnasium as gym
from gymnasium.wrappers import NormalizeObservation, NormalizeReward, ClipReward

# Setup reproducibility and PyTorch device
seed = 64
set_seed(seed)

device = set_device()

# Add extra wrappers to our environment
env = wrap_gym_env("InvertedPendulum-v5", [
    partial(NormalizeObservation, epsilon=1e-8),
    partial(NormalizeReward, gamma=0.99, epsilon=1e-8),
    partial(ClipReward, max_reward=10.0),
    # RecordEpisodeStatistics,  # Applied automatically!
    # partial(NumpyToTorch, device=device),  # Applied automatically!
])

# Or, use the standard gym API (recommended for this env)
env = gym.make("InvertedPendulum-v5")

# Set core variables
state_dim = env.observation_space.shape[0]  # in features
n_neurons = 20  # decision/hidden nodes
action_dim = env.action_space.shape[0]  # out features

buffer_size = 100_000
batch_size = 128

# Train a model
model = LiquidDDPG(
    state_dim, 
    n_neurons, 
    action_dim, 
    buffer_size=buffer_size,
    device=device,
)
model.train(env, batch_size, n_episodes=300)
```

Currently, the framework only supports [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) environments and is planned to expand to [PettingZoo](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/index.html) for Multi-agent (MARL) tasks.

## API Structure

The frameworks API is designed to be simple and intuitive. We've broken into two main categories: `core` and `extras`.

### Core

The primary building blocks you'll use regularly.

```python
from velora.models import [algorithm]
from velora.callbacks import [callback]
```

### Extras

Utility methods that you may use occasionally.

```python
from velora.gym import [method]
from velora.utils import [method]
```

## Customization

Customization is at the heart of Velora but requires a deeper understanding of the API.

You can read more about it in the [documentation tutorials](https://velora.achronus.dev/learn/customize).

## Active Development

ðŸš§ View the [Roadmap](https://velora.achronus.dev/starting/roadmap) ðŸš§

**Velora** is a tool that is continuously being developed. There's still a lot to do to make it a fully functioning framework, such as detailed API documentation, and more RL algorithms.

Our goal is to provide a quality open-source product that works 'out-of-the-box' that everyone can experiment with, and then gradually fix unexpected bugs and introduce more features on the road to a `v1` release.
