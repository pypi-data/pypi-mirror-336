# Smash

Smash is a build system for content. It enables you to define, using plain Python, how files in each directory should be transformed into outputs‚Äîwithout requiring global configuration, dependency graphs, or custom formats.

Each directory includes a `smashlet.py` file that specifies how files within that directory are processed. Smash automatically discovers and runs these smashlets.

---

### Problem

Make is powerful but often unintuitive. A distributed approach lets you understand individual parts of the system without needing to read and comprehend the entire build.

Workflow engines like Luigi or Airflow excel at orchestrating complex pipelines. Smash takes a simpler, directory-based approach that doesn't rely on global scheduling or dependency management.

Static site generators primarily target websites and often enforce templating or layout assumptions. Smash focuses purely on transforming and assembling content and data, free from layout or templating constraints.

Smash is useful when you prefer to colocate build logic alongside the files it operates on‚Äîusing plain Python, without central configuration or intricate dependency tracking.

---

### How Smash Works

Smash locates `smashlet.py` files within your project's directories. Each smashlet defines how the files in its own directory are transformed.

A `smashlet.py` contains:

- `INPUT_GLOB`: a glob pattern specifying input files (e.g., `"*.md"`)
- `OUTPUT_DIR`: the directory where output files are placed
- `run()`: a Python function that performs the file transformation

Smash traverses the project directories, finds all smashlets, and executes them in order based on their modification times (oldest first). After executing a smashlet, Smash automatically updates its timestamp. This process repeats until all smashlets are up-to-date.

Each smashlet operates independently. There is no central build configuration or dependency graph‚Äîevery smashlet contains the entirety of the information it requires.

---

### Why not Make, Luigi, or others?

Smash isn't trying to replace existing tools ‚Äî it's addressing a different kind of problem. Here's how it compares:

#### üõ†Ô∏è Make

Make is powerful and well-established, especially for compiling code. But as projects grow, Makefiles can become hard to read and maintain.

- Logic is centralized in a global file
- Understanding one part often requires understanding the whole
- Small changes can have unexpected global effects

Smash takes a distributed approach: each directory contains its own logic, in plain Python, with no global dependencies.

#### üîÅ Luigi / Airflow

Tools like Luigi and Airflow are designed for large-scale pipelines with task dependencies and scheduling.

- Best suited for DAGs and batch jobs
- Requires boilerplate and configuration for each task
- Overhead isn't justified for small, local workflows

Smash is aimed at simple, file-based transformations that live close to the content being processed.

#### üåê Static Site Generators

Static site generators (e.g., Jekyll, Hugo, Astro) are great for building websites ‚Äî but they assume a web-focused output.

- Templating and layout are built-in
- File structure is tied to routing
- Data and content are secondary to rendering

Smash doesn‚Äôt assume you‚Äôre building a website. It just helps you go from one kind of file to another, in a structure that you define.

---

### Basic Usage

Initialize a new Smash project:

```bash
smash init
```

This command creates a `.smash/` directory, marking the root of your project.

Add a `smashlet.py` file in each directory you want to define transformations.

Run Smash:

```bash
smash
```

Smash searches for all `smashlet.py` files from the project root, sorts them by modification time, and executes them in sequence. If any smashlet runs, the process repeats until no further transformations are needed.

---

### Smashlet Structure

A `smashlet.py` file defines how files in its directory should be processed. The structure is straightforward:

- `INPUT_GLOB`: selects input files using glob patterns
- `OUTPUT_DIR`: specifies where output files will be stored
- `run()`: defines the transformation logic

Example:

```python
INPUT_GLOB = "*.md"
OUTPUT_DIR = "dist/"

def run():
    from pathlib import Path

    inputs = list(Path(".").glob(INPUT_GLOB))
    Path(OUTPUT_DIR).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

    for f in inputs:
        content = f.read_text()
        html = f"<h1>{f.stem}</h1>\n<p>{content}</p>"

        out_path = Path(OUTPUT_DIR) / f.with_suffix(".html").name
        out_path.write_text(html)
```

Smash determines if a smashlet should run by comparing the modification times of its input files to the smashlet itself. After the `run()` function completes, Smash updates the smashlet's timestamp automatically.

---

### Shared Project Logic with `smash.py`

Smash supports an optional `smash.py` file in the root of your project. This file can be used for two things:

1. **Project-wide configuration and lifecycle hooks**
2. **Reusable helper functions** that can be imported in your smashlets

### Example `smash.py`

```python
# smash.py (in project root)

config = {
    "env": "production",
    "default_output": "dist/",
}

def on_context(context):
    context["version"] = "1.2.3"
    return context

# Utility functions usable in smashlets
def glob_from_root(pattern):
    from pathlib import Path
    return list((Path(__file__).parent / "").glob(pattern))

def read_json(path):
    import json
    return json.loads(path.read_text())
```

### In a smashlet:

```python
from smash import glob_from_root, read_json

def run(context):
    files = glob_from_root("data/**/*.json")
    for f in files:
        data = read_json(f)
        # ... process data
```

This approach keeps logic explicit, modular, and idiomatic. You can share config, helpers, and utilities across smashlets without global config files or complex imports.

## Project Layout Example

```
myproject/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .smash/                  # Created by `smash init`
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 001.md
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 002.md
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ smashlet.py      # Transforms .md files into HTML
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ part1.json
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ part2.json
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ smashlet.py      # Combines JSON files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ smash                    # CLI executable
```

Each directory with a `smashlet.py` independently defines its transformation logic. Smash identifies and executes these smashlets automatically.

---

### Use Cases

Smash is designed for structured content workflows where build logic benefits from colocation with the content itself. Common scenarios include:

- Generating structured documentation from multiple source fragments
- Rendering diagrams from `.dot` or `.plantuml` files stored across directories
- Merging content files into language-specific or region-specific outputs
- Creating structured data files for API endpoints or LLM input pipelines

---

### Philosophy and Contributing

Smash prioritizes simplicity and clarity. Every directory describes its own build logic independently, eliminating reliance on global configuration or shared state.

Key principles:

- No central dependency management
- No global build configuration
- No assumptions about content structure or output
- No enforced metadata formats or naming conventions

Contributions are welcome, particularly improvements to CLI usability, handling of edge cases, and reusable utilities for common transformations.
