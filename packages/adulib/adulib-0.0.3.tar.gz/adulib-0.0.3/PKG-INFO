# adulib


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

The lifecycle of a shared ADU utility or tool is as follows:

1.  Implement the utility in this repo.
2.  If the utility grows in complexity, it should be moved to its own
    dedicated package, and will be included in `adulib` as a
    (potentially optional) dependency.
