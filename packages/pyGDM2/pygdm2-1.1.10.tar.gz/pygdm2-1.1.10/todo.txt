TODO 1.1:
- pygdmUI -> test all functionalities
(- unit tests !?)
   

Further TODO:

fixes / tests:
- multipole development: higher order modes; scattering / extinction
- electric/magnetic dipole emitter with substrate: H, respectively E-field in farfield

small fixes
- autoscaling in `visu.structure`: adapt to screen dpi
- implement field-index info-printing in "simulation" class or in "tools"


add:
- coherent nonlinear effects
- femtosecond pulse


long-term:
- fully retarded 1-2-3 propagator: Field in layers 1 and 2
- Improve and test periodic structures "dyads" class:
   - Implement faster convergence technique for Dyad-calculation (e.g. Chaumet paper 2003)
   - test non-normal incidence (cf to MEEP?)
- 3-layer asymptotic propagators (Cl√©ment?)
- cunjugate gradients solver without full inversion. Using lookup-table for Green's functions (for all couples with same R, DeltaZ)?
- magnetic media (mu!=1) for metamaterial description


documentation:
----- TUTORIALS -----
- doc: tutorial on "structures": example of inconsistent geometry, e.g half/half in multi-layer environment
- doc: tutorial multi-materials

- doc: comprehensive explanation of "fieldindex"
- doc: improve "overview", add equations for physical model behind functions


tests:
- unit-test for propagators
- unit-tests for every incident field
- unit-test for "linear" / "nonlinear"
- unit-test for structures (to guarantee reproducibility)
- unit-tests for every material class
- unit-test for tools


----- EXAMPLES -----
- hollow TiO2 sphere (corresp. F. Mersch)

- Further 2D simulations example (spectra?)
- optical dichroism (RCP / LCP incident field)
- vector-beams with interface (Y. Brule)

- field-index tutorial
- EO:
  - directional antenna
  - magnetic LDOS ?
