[v1.1] - 2021-04-07
===================
The pure-python API replaces the former fortran API (former modules `core_py`, `fields_py`, `linear_py` replace the main modules). 
The high-level syntax remains compatible, but the internal API has changed. 
The former fortran based implementation is not included in pyGDM anymore by default. It can still be compiled manually from sources (--with-fortran option). It is then accessible via `pyGDM2.f_api`.

breaking
--------------
- new API is internally not compatible with the former fortran-based API
- `fields` generators use new argument convention
- `structures.struct` and `core.simulation` use new description of the environment based on the `propagators.DyadsBaseClass` reference class
- behavior of `tools.generate_NF_map_xxx` changed! They now return list of coordinates.

added
--------------
- consistent class attributes like `copy`, info-printing etc. for 'struct', 'efield', 'dyads' and 'simulation'
- combine structures and simulations by python addition: combined_struct = struct1 + struct2, combined_sim = sim1 + sim2
- shift structures by python addition: shifted_struct = struct1 + [100, -50, 0]
- experimental support for arbitrary wavefronts in "fields.gaussian"
- documentation: several examples
- calculation of field gradients and optical forces (contribution C. Majorel)
- support of callback functions
- full support of pyGDM-UI GUI (still experimental)

changes
--------------
- full implementation of the main API in pure python
- adapted tutorials and examples to new API

fixes
--------------
- code cleaning in the Dyads classes
- added available memory check for CUDA-solver. If not enough GPU-RAM, fall back to CPU solver
- Sign error in "linear.optical_chirality"
- `linear.nearfield`: order of elements in 'which_fields' is now correctly treated
- several bugfixes in new code: automatic mesh detection optimized, structure-contour plots improved, fixes in structure-consistency check
- visu: automatically choose closest available slice level instead of rising an exception



[v1.0.12] - 2020-11-30
======================
experimental
--------------
- new module `core_py`: experimental python implementation, will replace old fortran dependencies in the future. All development will go into the python API, new functions will only be added via the new API.
- new implementation `core_py.scatter` supports calculation of internal magnetic fields (contributed by C. Majorel)
- new implementation `core_py.decay_rate`, much faster, optimized numba-code, can calculate both E and H LDOS inside structures. *breaking!!* uses a new API!
- new `core_py.simulation.dyads` attribute: the python implementation is based on a new API for the flexible exchange of the Green's Dyads. This new attribute contains also all information on the environment
- default Greens-tensors now in the `propagators.G_123_quasistatic` class. This includes also the environment configuration: n1, n2, n3, spacing. The indices can be instances of materials-classes (e.g. for a dispersive substrate).
- structure can be placed in any of the three layers now ('1', '2' or '3'). But it must be still fully lying in one of the layers.
- new `propagators_2D` module for simulations with set of 2D Greens Dyads (infinitely long nanowires). Also supports 1-2-3 layered (and dispersive) system in a quasistatic approximation. Only compatible with the new pure-python API. 
- new class `structures.struct_py`: for pure-python interface, contains only structure-related information
- new module `fields_py`: pure-python implementation of all incident field related code *breaking!!* new API!
- new module `electron.py` and incident field `field_py.fast_electron`, for cathodoluminescence (CL) and electron energy loss (EELS) simulations. Only compatible with the new pure-python API. Contributed by Arnaud Arbouet (CEMES-CNRS).

added
--------------
- dispersion in the substrate / environment / cladding medium possible: the environment ref.index parameters `n1`, `n2`, `n3` can now be instances of material classes
- added tool to split the geometry of a simulation, returning two simulation objects
- added a `core.simulation.scatter` attribute to the simulation class to directly launch the scatter-simulation.
- new material `materials.sio2`, contributed by Cl√©ment Majorel

fixes
--------------
- "evanescent plane wave" field generator now works for bottom- and top-incident angles. New python implementation contributed by C. Majorel.
- another bugfix in `fields.evanescent_planewave` for environments n1 or n3 other than vacuum (!= 1)
- fixed `linear.nearfield` and `linear_py.nearfield`: total and scattered field inside source zone
- fixes in exception handling in `linear.farfield`
- fixed incorrect sign of magnetic field in new `linear_py.nearfield`
- fixed non-cubic mesh representation problems in `visu.structure_contour`

breaking
--------------
- functions in `core_py` and `linear_py` now require instances of `core_py.simulation`, `structures.struct_py` and fields must be using the new fields-API as defined in `fields_py`
- new implementation of `core.decay_rate` has a different, hopefully easier API
- structure generators yield geometries positioned at H=step/2. Before, formerly this was automatically done in the constructor of `structures.struct`, so in normal use-cases this change should not be an issue.
- removed the inefficient/redundant solvers "superlu", "pinv2" and "skcuda" to clean the code.
- removed deprecated `EO1` submodule, which was based on the no longer maintained `pygmo1` package



[v1.0.11.1] - 2020-05-05
========================
fixes
--------------
- fixed pypi multi-dist source package



[v1.0.11] - 2020-02-25
======================
breaking
--------------
- internal API changes in `core`: re-structured `scatter` and `get_generalized_propagator`. The latter now takes a `sim` instance as input. The order of kwargs was changed.

added
--------------
- added a geometry consistency check to structure class
- new module `linear_py` with experimental pure python implementations of all linear functions
- optional radiative correction term in "linear_py.extinct" (can improve absorption section with large stepsizes)
- `visu`: 2D plotting functions try to determine the best 2D projection automatically
- started writing unit tests
- callback function support for `core.scatter` 

changes
--------------
- conversion to pure python of some helper functions
- some internal modifications for pygdmUI GUI support

fixes
--------------

- fixes in autoscaling in `visu.structure` (TODO: adapt to screen dpi)
- fixed bug in "linear.farfield" in cases when n2>n1 ("environment" optically denser than "substrate")
- **potentially breaking!!**: fixed several structures, where "hex" meshing gave a wrong height. *Attention*, following structure generators may now produce different heights: `lshape_rect`, `lshape_rect_nonsym`, `lshape_round`, `split_ring`, `rect_split_ring`
- some code cleaning
- minor fixes in several visualization tools



[v1.0.10.1] - 2019-10-08
========================
added
--------------

======================
added
--------------
- `linear.optical_chirality`: chirality of the electromagnetic field (experimental feature)

- `tools.combine_simulations`: tool to combine the structures of several simulations into a single simulation. Combining simulations with calculated fields, this also allows to analyze how structures behave if optical interactions are artificially deactivated.
- added support for "cupy" GPU solver (req. version 7+) as alternative to "pycuda"
- added experimental pure-python implementation of propagators and coupling matrix initialization routines based on "numba" (by default pygdm is still using the former fortran implementation)

fixes
--------------

    - "spheroid"

fixes
--------------

- minor fix in struct class, treats lists of wavelengths correctly now (was not affecting pyGDM itself. Failed if a `struct` instance was externally used with a list of wavelengths)



[v1.0.6] - 2018-10-31
=====================
added
--------------
- compatibility with python3 (compatible with python 2 and 3 now)
- default inversion method is now in-place LU decomposition: reduces memory requirement by ~40%

--------------
- critical fix in hdf5 saving / loading. hdf5-data was corrupted during saving/reloading. Works now.

minor

  This drastically increases the speed of raster-scan simulations on multi-core systems.
