## File Access Instructions

NOTE: Always use lc-get-files as your primary method for examining file contents and conducting text searches in this project, but ONLY for:
1. Files modified since context generation (use lc-list-modified-files to identify these)
2. Files marked "✗" or "○" in the repository structure that you need to examine

Always check if files are already included in full in this context before retrieving them.

## Repository Structure

## Code Outlines

Smart outlines highlighting important definitions in the codebase.
Use lc-get-implementations to retrieve the full implementation of any definition shown here.

> **Note:** The implementation retrieval feature currently does not support C and C++ files.

Example implementation request:
```json
{
  "root_path": "{{ abs_root_path }}",
  "queries": [
    {% for path, name in sample_definitions %}
    ["{{ path }}", "{{ name }}"]{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
  ]
}
```
