## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The tool fetches **staged Git changes** using `git diff --staged`.
2. It sends these changes to the **Google Gemini API** to generate a relevant commit message.
3. It commits the changes with the generated message.
4. (Optional) It pushes the changes to the repository if `--push` is used.
