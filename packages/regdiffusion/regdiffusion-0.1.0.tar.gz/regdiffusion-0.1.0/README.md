RegDiffusion is a very fast unsupervised regulatory network inference algorithm (just like GENIE3 and GRNBoost2), based on probabilistic diffusion model. It works well on genes and is capable to rapidly (<5min) predict biologically verifiable links from large single cell RNA-seq data with 14,000+ genes.

## Installation

RegDiffusion is on pypi.

```
pip install regdiffusion
```

Check out the [this tutorial](https://tuftsbcb.github.io/RegDiffusion/quick_tour.html) for a quick tour of how to use RegDiffusion! If you would like to integrate results from RegDiffusion into the SCENIC pipeline, checkout [this tutorial](https://tuftsbcb.github.io/RegDiffusion/downstream_with_pyscenic.html). 

## Inferred Networks from RegDiffusion
Here are two examples of inferred networks from regdiffusion. The networks are coherent with existing literature and across datasets.

## Inference Speed
Inference on networks with 15,000 genes takes under 5 minutes on an A100 GPU. 
In contrast, previous VAE based models would take more than 4 hours on the same 
device. Even if you don't have access to those fancy GPU cards, RegDiffusion 
still works. Inference on the same large network takes roughly 3 hours on a 
mid-range 12-core CPU. 

## CLI tool
regdiffusion has a CLI tool now! It takes a count matrix as the input (different from the main API, which needs the data to be log transformed) and returns a table of inferred edges. 

```
usage: regdiffusion [-h] [--output OUTPUT] [--top_gene_percentile TOP_GENE_PERCENTILE] [--k K] [--workers WORKERS] input

Infer a gene regulatory network (GRN) from a single-cell count dataset.

positional arguments:
  input                 Input single-cell count dataset file (CSV or H5AD format).

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --output OUTPUT       Output file path for the edgelist (CSV). Default: rd_grn.csv
  --top_gene_percentile TOP_GENE_PERCENTILE
                        Percentile cutoff to filter weak edges (e.g., 50 for the top 50%). Default: 50
  --k K                 Number of edges per gene to extract (-1 for all edges). Default: -1
  --workers WORKERS     Number of workers to use for edgelist extraction. Default: 4
