## Utility tools for rodent system neuroscience research, including Open Source Wrapper or Parser

## See the [Documentation ](https://neuralib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [Examples](https://github.com/ytsimon2004/neuralib/tree/main/doc/source/notebooks)

## Checkout [Release notes](https://github.com/ytsimon2004/neuralib/releases)

# Installation

- MODULE_OPTION: `atlas`, `scanner`, `imaging`, `segmentation`, `model`, `gpu`, `profile`, `imagelib`, `tools`,
  `all`

## conda environment

- Create and activate a new conda environment (Python >=3.10, but >=3.12 not yet tested), then install:

```shell
conda create -n neuralib python=3.10
conda activate neuralib
pip install neura-library
```

- If you wish to install **all dependencies**, run:

```shell
pip install neura-library[all]
```

- If you wish to install the **minimal required dependencies** according to usage purpose:

```shell
pip install neura-library[MODULE_OPTION]
```

## uv virtual environment

- Install uv, run in Unix or git bash (Windows):

```shell
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

- Follow uv project structure [doc](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/#creating-a-new-project):

```shell
uv init
```

- Make sure python version (>=3.10, but >=3.12 not yet tested), both in `pyproject.py` and `.python-version`

```shell
uv python install 3.10
```

- If you wish to install **all dependencies**, run:

```shell
uv add neura-library[MODULE_OPTION]
```
