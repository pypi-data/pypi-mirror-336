Versions marked with * are partially working
# Showcase
In [this](./READMES/) folder you can check out some more in depth showcase of some of the topics I have covered in this package

### [`isoftype`](./READMES/isoftype.md)
-- _"Boost your type checking game with `isoftype`: Effortlessly verify object types and subtypes, handle complex data structures, and tackle union types in Python!"_

**Support for Parametrized Generics**
### [`@overload`](./READMES/overload.md)
-- _"Manage function overloads with ease: Introducing `@overload` to handle specific resolutions and simplify function overloading in Python!"_

**Support for function overloading**
### [`@validate`](./READMES/validate.md)
-- _"Safeguard your code with `@validate`: Protecting against type-related disasters and ensuring type safety in Python functions!"_

**Runtime argument type validation for functions**
### [`tlist`](./READMES/tlist.md)
-- _"Elevate your list safety with `tlist`: Empower your code with runtime type safety, seamless list operations, and enhanced control over list elements!"_

**Like `list` but with runtime type validation**
### [`Interface`](./READMES/Interface.md)
-- _"Unlock the Power of Interfaces in Python: Create Your Own Metaclass for Interface-Like Behavior and Enhance Your Object-Oriented Programming Skills!"_

**Learning `metaclasses` by implementing an `Interface` (and `Abstract Classes`) for python in python**
