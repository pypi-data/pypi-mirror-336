## 1. Overview

Pyon is built on top of JSON, but goes beyond standard JSON encoding a wide range of Python-specific data types. \
Whether you are working with typical Python containers, specialized data structures for AI/ML, or custom classes, Pyon aims to seamlessly serialize and deserialize them.

Key goals include:

- **Robustness**: Proper handling of complex or custom Python objects.  
- **Efficiency**: Designed for data-intensive applications such as ML or large-scale data pipelines.  
- **Extensibility**: Future reliases will add support for new data types.

---
<br>

## 2. Simplified Interface

Pyon provides a straightforward interface with four main methods:

- **`encode(obj)`**: Serialize a Python object into a Pyon string.

- **`decode(data)`**: Deserialize a Pyon string into the corresponding Python object.

- **`to_file(obj, file_path)`**: Serialize a Python object and save the resulting data to a file.

- **`from_file(file_path)`**: Load data from a file and deserialize it into the corresponding Python object.

Each of these methods automatically detects the data type and applies the appropriate serialization or deserialization logic.

---
<br>

## 3. Supported Types

Pyon supports a broad array of Python types out-of-the-box:
<br/>

**1. Base Types**
- `bool`, `float`, `int`, `str`, `type`, `None`

**2. Numeric Types**
- `complex`, `decimal.Decimal`

**3. Collection Types**
- `bytearray`, `bytes`, `frozenset`, `list`, `set`, `tuple`
- `ChainMap`, `Counter`, `defaultdict`, `deque`, `namedtuple` (collections)

**4. Datetime Types**
- `datetime.date`, `datetime.datetime`, `datetime.time`

**5. Mapping Types**
- `class` (user defined classes), `dataclasses.dataclass`, `dict`, `Enum`

**6. Specialized Types**
- `bitarray.bitarray`, `numpy.ndarray`, `pandas.DataFrame`, `pyon.File`, `uuid.UUID`

## 4. Installation

Pyon is planned to be released on PyPI. Once available, you can install it via:

```bash
pip install pyon-core
```

If the package is not yet on PyPI, you can install directly from the source:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/eonflux-ai/pyon.git
```

*The package 'pion-core' is engine behind the upcoming Pyon ecosystem. If the original PyPI package 'pyon' is released, this package will become its foundation.*

<br>

## 5. Quick Start

Below are some quick examples to help you get started.

### Basic Serialization and Deserialization

```python
import pyon

# 1. Python Data: Classes, Collections, Dataframes, Numpy arrays, etc...
data = {...}

# 2. One line Encode and Decode...
encoded = pyon.encode(data)
decoded = pyon.decode(encoded)

# 3. One line Encode and Decode to and from File...
pyon.to_file(data, "data.pyon")
decoded = pyon.from_file("data.pyon")
```

---
<br>

## 6. Examples

Pyon includes a wide set of examples to demonstrate its capabilities in handling different data types and scenarios.  
These examples are located in the `examples/` directory and provide practical use cases for serialization and deserialization.

Check **[EXAMPLES.md](examples/EXAMPLES.md)** for more information.

---
<br>

## 7. Recursion in Encoding and Decoding (Nested Types)

Pyon excels at handling recursive data structures seamlessly. Whether your data includes deeply nested dictionaries, lists, or custom objects, Pyon ensures accurate serialization and deserialization across all levels.

```python
import pyon

# 1. Test Objects...
example_data = {

    # 1.1 Tuple, Set...
    "tuple-set": ({"abc", "def"}),

    # 1.2 List, Tuple, Set...
    "list-tuple-set": [({"abc", "def"}), ({1, 2}), ({True, False})],

    # 1.3 Dict, List, Tuple, Set...
    "dict-list-tuple-set": {
        "a": [({"abc", "def"}), ({1, 2}), ({True, False})]
    },

    # 1.4 Dict, Dict, List, Tuple, Set...
    "dict-dict-list-tuple-set": {
        "one": {"a": [({"abc", "def"}), ({1, 2}), ({True, False})]},
        "two": {"b": [({"ghi", "jkl"}), ({3.0, 4.0}), ({True, False})]}
    }

}

# 2. One Line encode and decode...
encoded = pyon.encode(example_data)
decoded = pyon.decode(encoded)
```

Pyon's recursive encoding and decoding provide a reliable way to handle arbitrarily complex structures, making it ideal for advanced use cases like configuration management, AI/ML pipelines, or hierarchical datasets.

### **Key Highlights**

1. **Public Interface**:

   - The `api.py` file provides a high-level interface for users, exposing key methods like `encode`, `decode`, `to_file`, and `from_file` for seamless serialization and deserialization.

   - The `encoder.py` file in the root directory serves as the public interface for encoding/decoding logic, while the internal logic is delegated to submodules in `encoders/`.

2. **Encoders Modularization**:

   - The `encoders/` directory contains submodules for handling specific types of data (e.g., basic types, collections, numeric types).
   - This improves scalability and separates the encoding logic from the main `encoder.py` file.

3. **Testing Structure**:

   - The `tests/` directory mirrors the project’s modular structure, with subtests for each encoder submodule.

This structure ensures clarity, scalability, and ease of maintenance as the project evolves. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contribute!

## 9. Encoders

The **encoders** in Pyon are modularized to handle different data types efficiently. The main `encoder.py` file serves as the public interface for encoding and decoding, while the internal logic is organized into submodules within the `encoders/` directory.

Each submodule is responsible for specific categories of data types, ensuring maintainability and scalability. Below is an overview of the encoders and the types they manage:


| **Encoder**         | **Types**                                                                               |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `base_types`        | `bool`, `float`, `int`, `str`, `type`, `None`                                           |
| `numeric_types`     | `complex`, `decimal.Decimal`                                                            |
| `collection_types`  | `bytearray`, `bytes`, `frozenset`, `list`, `set`, `tuple`                               |
|                     | `ChainMap`, `Counter`, `defaultdict`, `deque`, `namedtuple` (from collections)          |
| `datetime_types`    | `datetime.date`, `datetime.datetime`, `datetime.time`                                   |
| `mapping_types`     | `class` (user defined classes), `dataclasses.dataclass`, `dict`, `Enum`                 |
| `specialized_types` | `bitarray.bitarray`, `numpy.ndarray`, `pandas.DataFrame`, `pyon.File`, `uuid.UUID`      |


This modularization simplifies the process of adding support for new data types and ensures that each encoder submodule focuses solely on its designated category of data.

As the building blocks for other types, the base types don't require encoding and decoding.

## 10. Testing

Pyon uses **pytest** for automated testing. The test suite covers:

- Serialization and deserialization for all supported types.  
- Validation of valid, invalid, and null inputs.  
- Logging of errors with `caplog` and temporary file handling with `tmp_path`.

To run the tests locally:

```bash
cd Pyon
pytest
```
