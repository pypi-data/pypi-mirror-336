```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Jumitti/lcd_home_automation.git@package
```
With Pypi:

```bash
pip install LCD_16x2
```

### Cloning repo

- Install git

  ```sh
  sudo apt install git
  ```

- Clone the repo in your home directory

  ```sh
  cd /home/${USER}/
  git clone https://github.com/the-raspberry-pi-guy/lcd.git
  cd lcd/
  ```

- Run the automatic installation script with `sudo` permission

  ```sh
  sudo ./install.sh
  ```

- During the installation, pay attention to any messages about `python` and `python3` usage, as they inform which version you should use to interface with the LCD driver.  For example:

  ```txt
  [LCD] [INFO] You may use either 'python' or 'python3' to interface with the lcd.
  ```

  or alternatively,

  ```txt
  [LCD] [INFO] Use 'python3' to interface with the lcd.
  ```

- At the end of the installation script, you'll be prompted to reboot the RPi to apply the changes made to `/boot/config.txt` and `/etc/modules`.

- After rebooting, try one of the [**demos**](#demos):

  ```sh
  ./home/${USER}/lcd/demo/demo_clock.py
  ```

  or

  ```sh
  python /home/${USER}/lcd/demo/demo_clock.py
  ```

  or

  ```sh
  python3 /home/${USER}/lcd/demo/demo_clock.py
  ```

## Demos

A list of demonstration (demo) files that illustrate how to use the LCD driver.  Demos are ordered alphabetically.

### Backlight Control

- Author: [@Tomtom0201](https://github.com/Tomtom0201)

This demo showcases the backlight control of the LCD, which is available on some hardware:

<p align="center">
  <img src="imgs/demo_backlight.gif" width="50%">
</p>

### Custom characters

- Author: [@juvus](https://github.com/juvus)

It is possible to define in CG RAM memory up to 8 custom characters. These characters can be prompted on LCD the same way as any characters from the [characters table](imgs/characters_table.png). Codes for the custom characters are unique and as follows:

  1. `{0x00}`
  2. `{0x01}`
  3. `{0x02}`
  4. `{0x03}`
  5. `{0x04}`
  6. `{0x05}`
  7. `{0x06}`
  8. `{0x07}`

Please, see the comments and implementation in the [`demo_lcd_custom_characters.py`](demo_lcd_custom_characters.py) file for more details on how to use custom characters. Thanks to [@Jumitti](https://github.com/Jumitti), there is also [a web app you can use to generate custom characters](https://custom-characters-for-lcd16x2.streamlit.app/) by drawing them on a matrix.

### Emulator

- Author: [@Jumitti](https://github.com/Jumitti)
- ``Tkinter`` Python package: standard library (on **WINDOWS**).
  - If there is an error, how to install on **Debian/Ubuntu**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3-tk
    ```
    On **macOS**:
    ```bash
    brew install python-tk
    ```

Just a 16x2 LCD screen simulator using Tkinter, allowing for easy testing and visualization of LCD displays without physical hardware. This simulator helps in developing and debugging LCD-based projects directly from a computer.
Especially if you don't have your Raspberry and LCD with you.

Some nice features are in addition. You can change the title and size of the Tkinter window, change the font and the 
font size, the color of the background and the text (the [Backlight control](#backlight-control) is reverse colors).

The font size and [Custom characters](#custom-characters) adapt to the size of the Tkinter window.
And because it is an emulator, if you wanted to add or remove columns and lines you can do it


**How to use:**
- ``import drivers`` => ``import emulators``
- ``Lcd()`` => ``LcdEmulator()``
- ``CustomCharacters`` => ``CustomCharactersEmulator()``

Suggested beginning program:

```Python
from lcd_16x2 import emulators

display = emulators.LcdEmulator()
cc = emulators.CustomCharactersEmulator(display)

# Then the rest of your finest feats
```

All other functions are the same. **Please refer to [demo_emulator.py](demo_emulator.py)**

**Personalization of your Tkinter window**

- **Parameters for `LcdEmulator()`**
```Python
from lcd_16x2 import emulators

display = emulators.LcdEmulator(TITTLE_WINDOWS="Hello World",
                                LCD_BACKGROUND="pale turquoise", LCD_FOREGROUND="orange",
                                SESSION_STATE_BACKLIGHT=1,
                                FONT="Arial", FONT_SIZE=50,
                                COLUMNS=16, ROWS=2, CHAR_WIDTH=50)
```

### Extended strings

- Author: [@juvus](https://github.com/juvus)

This is demo showcases how extended strings could be used. Extended strings can contain special placeholders of form `{0xFF}`, that is, a hex code of the symbol wrapped within curly brackets. Hex codes of various symbols can be found in the following characters table:

<p align="center">
  <img src="imgs/characters_table.png" width="50%">
</p>

For example, the hex code of the symbol `Ã¶` is `0xEF`, and so this symbol could be printed on the second row of the display by using the `{0xEF}` placeholder, as follows:

```Python
display.lcd_display_extended_string("{0xEF}", 2)
```

If you want to combine placeholder to write a symbol `{0xFF}` with the native Python placeholder `{0}` for inserting dome data into text, escape the non-native placeholders. Here is an example:

```Python
display.lcd_display_extended_string("Symbol:{{0xEF}} data:{0}".format(5), 2)
```

- Additional Python package requirements: `pip`, `requests`, `bs4`

To install the requirements, follow this procedure:

- Install `pip` and use it to install the remaining packages

    ```sh
    sudo apt install python-pip
    pip install requests bs4
    ```

### Home Automation

- Author: [@Jumitti](https://github.com/Jumitti)
- Repository: [Jumitti/lcd_home_automation](https://github.com/Jumitti/lcd_home_automation)

This implementation shows how to use the LCD to display messages from temperature sensors and services such as Spotify and Trakt (see below). The implementation also features an integration with Telegram to turn the LCD backlight on/off and send a few other commands to control the host machine (e.g., get the temperature, reboot, shutdown). [@Jumitti](https://github.com/Jumitti) documented the project on its own [Home Automation repository](https://github.com/Jumitti/lcd_home_automation), so make sure to check it out if you want to learn more about it.

### NetMonitor

- Author: [@cgomesu](https://github.com/cgomesu)

This demo uses `ping` and `nc` (netcat) to monitor the network status of hosts and services, respectively. Hosts and services can be modified by editing their respective [dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries):

```Python
hosts = {
    'Internet': '8.8.8.8',
    'Firewall': '192.168.1.1',
    'NAS': '192.168.1.2'
}
services = {
    'Cameras': {'ip': '192.168.1.2', 'port': '8000'},
    'Plex': {'ip': '192.168.1.2', 'port': '32400'}
}
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="imgs/demo_netmonitor.gif" width="50%">
</p>

### Progress bar

- Author: [@juvus](https://github.com/juvus)

This is a demo of a graphical progress bar created with [custom characters](#custom-characters). This bar could be used, for example, for showing the current level of battery charge.

<p align="center">
  <img src="imgs/demo_progress_bar.jpg" width="50%">
</p>

### Tiny dashboard

- Author: [@jdarias](https://github.com/jdarias)

This is a script that shows a famous quote, a currency conversion pair of your choice and the weather of a city. It also shows the last three characters from your ip address, the date in DDMM format and the hour in HH:MM format

<p align="center">
  <img src="imgs/demo_tiny_dashboard.gif" width="50%">
</p>

The script takes info from the following APIs:

- [quotable.io](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable): Free public API that provides famous quotes from well known people. It has a public endpoint that doesn't require an API key.

- [exchangerate-api.com](https://exchangerate-api.com) / [free.currencyconverterapi.com](https://free.currencyconverterapi.com): There are a lot of currency apis but these ones offer free currency exchange info. Both are used, one as main, the other as backup. Requires an API key to use.

- [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org): Provides Weather info, forecasts, etc. Requires an API key to use.

In order to use the script, you need to get **API key tokens for both exchange rate services and the weather api**. Once you've done that, edit the script to put your tokens in the USER VARIABLES section.

Also set a currency exchange pair. For currency support and the currency codes you need to use, see [exchangerate-api.com/docs/supported-currencies](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/docs/supported-currencies).

A city/country string is also needed to show weather info for such city. Search for your city on [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org) and take note of the `City,country` string and put it in the script.`London,gb` is given as an example.

## Implementation

Once you are done editing a `demo_*.py` file or writing your own Python script, follow the instructions on this section to run the script in the background. First, however, ensure that the script (e.g., `script.py`) has at least permission to be executed, as follows:

```sh
sudo chmod +x script.py
```

Similarly, file ownership can be configured via `chown`.  For example, to set the user `${USER}` as owner of the file `script.py`, run the following:

```sh
sudo chown ${USER} script.py
```

## Systemd

Use the following procedure to run any LCD Python script as a (systemd) service:

1. Create a new unit file in `/lib/systemd/system/` called `rpi-lcd.service`:

   ```sh
   sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/rpi-lcd.service
   ```

2. Copy and paste the following in the new unit file:

   (*If your user is different than `pi`, remember to edit the `User=` entry.*)

   ```sh
   [Unit]
   Description=RPi Python script for a 16x2 LCD

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   ## Edit the following according to the script permissions
   User=pi
   #Group=users

   ## Edit the following with the full path to the compatible Python version and your script
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/python /path/to/script.py

   Restart=always
   RestartSec=5

   KillMode=process
   KillSignal=SIGINT

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

3. Enable the service and start it:

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl enable rpi-lcd.service
   sudo systemctl start rpi-lcd.service
   ```

4. Check that the LCD is displaying the correct information; otherwise, check the service status:

   ```sh
   systemctl status rpi-lcd.service
   ```
