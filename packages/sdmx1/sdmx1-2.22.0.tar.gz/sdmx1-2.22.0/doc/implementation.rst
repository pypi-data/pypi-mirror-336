Implementation notes
********************

:mod:`sdmx` aims for a **precise, Pythonic, and useful implementation of the SDMX standards**.
This means:

- Classes and their attributes have the names, types, cardinality, and directionality given in the standard.

  - Where the standard has non-Pythonic names (for instance, "dimensionAtObservation"), :mod:`sdmx` follows the `PEP-8 naming conventions <https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#naming-conventions>`_ (for instance, "dimension_at_observation" for a class attribute).
  - Where the standard is ambiguous or imprecise itself, implementation (for instance, naming) choices in :mod:`sdmx` are clearly labelled.

- Extensions, additional features, and conveniences in :mod:`sdmx` that do not appear in the standards are clearly labeled.
- All behaviour visible “in the wild”—that is, from publicly available data sources and files—is either:

  - supported, if it is verifiably standards-compliant, or
  - tolerated if otherwise, so long as this does not complicate the implementation of standards.
    Non-standard content is flagged using log messages and by other means.

This page gives brief explanations of **how** this implementation is achieved.
Although this page is organized (see the contents in the sidebar) to correspond to the standards, it (:ref:`again <not-the-standard>`) **does not restate them** or set out to explain all their details.
For those purposes, see :doc:`resources`; or the :doc:`walkthrough`, which includes some incidental explanations.

.. _sdmx-version-policy:

Standards versions
==================

SDMX standards documents are available `on the SDMX website <https://sdmx.org/?page_id=5008>`__ and via links to other locations.
Multiple versions of the SDMX standards have been adopted:

- 2.0 in November 2005.
- 2.1 in August 2011; published at the International Standards Organization (ISO) in January 2013; and revised multiple times since.
- 3.0.0 in October 2021.
- 3.1 planned for some time in 2025.

Some notes about the organization of the standards:

- In SDMX 2.1, **‘sections’** of the standards were numbered from 1 to 7.
  For instance, the :ref:`im` is referred to as “Section 2”.

  - This is distinct from numbered sections or headings *within* the particular standards documents.
    For instance, SDMX 2.1 Section 2 “Information Model/UML Conceptual Design” is a document that contains numbered sections/headings such as “2. Actors and Use Cases” and “2.1. Introduction.”
    Documentation and code comments for the :mod:`sdmx` package attempts to be unambiguous about such references, and uses the “§” character to refer to these (sub-)headings.
- From SDMX 3.0.0, some of these section numbers have been removed or disused.
  For instance, the SDMX-ML file format was described in SDMX 2.1 sections 3A and 3B; in SDMX 3.0.0, these section numbers are no longer used, replaced with a reference to the SDMX Technical Working Group (TWG) Git repository at https://github.com/sdmx-twg/sdmx-ml.
- Some of the sections or component standards are versioned differently from SDMX as a whole.
  The following table lists the *apparent* correspondences between versions of the component standards (The SDMX TWG does not publish such a table, so this should not be taken as official):

  ======== ========================== =============== =============== ==========================
  SDMX     SDMX-REST                  SDMX-CSV        SDMX-JSON       SDMX-ML
  ======== ========================== =============== =============== ==========================
  1.0      (not versioned separately) (did not exist) (did not exist) (not versioned separately)
  2.0      (not versioned separately) (did not exist) (did not exist) (not versioned separately)
  2.1      1.x; latest 1.5            1.0             1.0             (not versioned separately)
  3.0.0    2.x; latest 2.2            2.0.0           2.0.0           3.0.0
  3.1      ?                          ?               ?               ?
  ======== ========================== =============== =============== ==========================

  See further details under the :ref:`sdmx-csv`, :ref:`sdmx-json`, and :ref:`sdmx-rest` sections, below.
- The version numbers `do not <https://github.com/sdmx-twg/sdmx-3_1_0/issues/1#issuecomment-2519837607>`_ follow the `semantic versioning <https://semver.org>`_ system.
  This means that increments to the second (3.0 → 3.1) or first (3.1 → 4.0) version part do not necessarily indicate the presence/absence of 'breaking' or backwards-incompatible changes.

For the current Python package, :mod:`sdmx`:

- **SDMX 2.0** is not implemented, and no implementation is currently planned.

  - Some data providers still exist which only offer SDMX-ML 2.0 and/or an SDMX 2.0 REST web service.
    These implementations of SDMX 2.0 can be incomplete, inconsistent, or not fully compliant.
    This makes it more difficult and costly to support them.
  - While no SDMX 2.0 implementation is planned, contributions from new developers are possible and welcome.

- **SDMX 2.1 and 3.0.0** are implemented as described on this page, with exhaustive implementation as the design goal for :mod:`sdmx`.
- For **SDMX 3.0.0** specifically, as of v2.14.0 :mod:`sdmx` implements:

  - The SDMX 3.0.0 information model (:mod:`.model.v30`), to the same extent as SDMX 2.1.
  - Reading of SDMX-ML 3.0.0 (:mod:`.reader.xml.v30`).
  - Construction of URLs and querying SDMX-REST API v2.1.0 data sources (:mod:`.rest.v30`).

  This implies the following are not yet supported:

  - Writing SDMX-ML 3.0.0.
  - Reading and writing SDMX-JSON 2.0 (see :ref:`sdmx-json`).

  Follow the :doc:`whatsnew` and GitHub issues and pull requests with the `'sdmx-3' label <https://github.com/khaeru/sdmx/labels/sdmx-3>`__ for details.
  Please `open an issue <https://github.com/khaeru/sdmx/issues>`_ on GitHub to report examples of real-world SDMX 3.0.0 web services examples and specimens of data that can be added.

.. _im:

Information model (SDMX-IM)
===========================

Reference:

- `SDMX 2.1 Section 2 — Information Model <https://sdmx.org/wp-content/uploads/SDMX_2-1-1_SECTION_2_InformationModel_201108.pdf>`_ (PDF).
- `SDMX 3.0.0 Section 2 — Information Model <https://sdmx.org/wp-content/uploads/SDMX_3-0-0_SECTION_2_FINAL-1_0.pdf>`_ (PDF).

In general:

- :mod:`sdmx.model.common` implements:

  1. Classes that are fully identical in the SDMX 2.1 and 3.0.0 information models.
  2. Base classes like :class:`.BaseDataStructureDefinition` that contain **common attributes and features** shared by SDMX 2.1 and 3.0.0 classes that differ in some ways.
     These classes should not be instantiated or used directly, except for type checking and hinting.

- :mod:`sdmx.model.v21` and :mod:`sdmx.model.v30` contain:

  1. Classes that only appear in one version of the information models or other other.
  2. Concrete implementations of common base classes—for instance :class:`.v21.DataStructureDefinition` and :class:`.v30.DataStructureDefinition`—with the features specific to each version of the information model.

Python :mod:`dataclasses` and type hinting are used to enforce the types of attributes that reference instances of other classes.
Some classes have convenience attributes not mentioned in the spec, to ease navigation between related objects.
These are marked “:mod:`sdmx` extension not in the IM.”

.. _im-base-classes:

Abstract classes and data types
-------------------------------

Many classes inherit from one of the following.
For example, every :class:`.Code` is a :class:`.NameableArtefact`; [2]_ this means it has `name` and `description` attributes. Because every :class:`.NameableArtefact` is an :class:`.IdentifiableArtefact`, a Code also has `id`, `URI`, and `URN` attributes.

:class:`.AnnotableArtefact`
   - has a list of :attr:`~.AnnotableArtefact.annotations`.
   - Each annotation has :attr:`~.Annotation.id`, :attr:`~.Annotation.title`, :attr:`~.Annotation.type`, and :attr:`~.Annotation.url` attributes, as well as a :attr:`~.Annotation.text`.
   - The Annotation `text` attribute is an :class:`.InternationalString` with zero or more :attr:`localizations <.InternationalString.localizations>` in different locales.
     This provides support for internationalization of SDMX structures and metadata in multiple languages.

:class:`.IdentifiableArtefact`
   - has an :attr:`~.IdentifiableArtefact.id`, :attr:`URI <.IdentifiableArtefact.uri>`, and :attr:`URN <.IdentifiableArtefact.urn>`.
   - is “annotable”; this means it is a subclass of :class:`.AnnotableArtefact` and *also* has the `annotations` attribute.

   The ``id`` uniquely identifies the object against others of the same type in a SDMX message.
   The URI and URN are *globally* unique. See `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier#URLs_and_URNs>`_ for a discussion of the differences between the two.

:class:`.NameableArtefact`
   - has a :attr:`name <.NameableArtefact.name>` and :attr:`description <.NameableArtefact.description>`, both :class:`.InternationalString`, and
   - is identifiable, therefore *also* annotable.

:class:`.VersionableArtefact`
   - has a :attr:`version <.VersionableArtefact.version>` number,
   - may be valid between certain times (:attr:`valid_from <.VersionableArtefact.valid_from>`, :attr:`valid_to <.VersionableArtefact.valid_to>`), and
   - is nameable, identifiable, and annotable.

:class:`.MaintainableArtefact`
   - is under the authority of a particular :attr:`maintainer <.MaintainableArtefact.maintainer>`, and
   - is versionable, nameable, identifiable, and annotable.

   In an SDMX message, a maintainable object might not be given in full; only as a reference (with :attr:`is_external_reference <.MaintainableArtefact.is_external_reference>` set to :obj:`True`).
   If so, it might have a :attr:`structure_url <.MaintainableArtefact.structure_url>`, where the maintainer provides more information about the object.

The API reference for :mod:`sdmx.model` shows the parent classes for each class, to describe whether they are maintainable, versionable, nameable, identifiable, and/or annotable.

.. [2] Indirectly, through :class:`.Item`.

Items and schemes
-----------------

:class:`.ItemScheme`, :class:`.Item`
   These abstract classes allow for the creation of flat or hierarchical taxonomies.

   ItemSchemes are maintainable (see above); their  :attr:`~.ItemScheme.items` is a collection of Items.
   See the class documentation for details.

Data
----

:class:`Observation <.BaseObservation>`
   A single data point/datum.

   The value is stored as the :attr:`Observation.value <.BaseObservation.value>` attribute.

:class:`DataSet <.BaseDataSet>`
   A collection of Observations, SeriesKeys, and/or GroupKeys.

   .. note:: **There are no 'Series' or 'Group' classes** in the IM!

     Instead, the *idea* of 'data series' within a DataSet is modeled as:

     - SeriesKeys and GroupKeys are associated with a DataSet.
     - Observations are each associated with one SeriesKey and, optionally, referred to by one or more GroupKeys.

     One can choose to think of a SeriesKey *and* the associated Observations, collectively, as a 'data series'.
     But, in order to avoid confusion with the IM, :mod:`sdmx` does not provide 'Series' or 'Group' objects.

   :mod:`sdmx` provides:

   - the :attr:`DataSet.series <.BaseDataSet.series>` and :attr:`DataSet.group <.BaseDataSet.group>` mappings from SeriesKey or GroupKey (respectively) to lists of Observations.
   - :attr:`DataSet.obs <.BaseDataSet.obs>`, which is a list of *all* observations in the DataSet.

   Depending on its structure, a DataSet may be :term:`flat`, :term:`cross-sectional` or :term:`time series`.

:class:`.Key`
   Values (:attr:`.Key.values`) for one or more Dimensions.
   The meaning varies:

   Ordinary Keys, e.g. :attr:`Observation.dimension <.BaseObservation.dimension>`
      The dimension(s) varying at the level of a specific observation.

   :class:`.SeriesKey`
      The dimension(s) shared by all Observations in a conceptual series.

   :class:`.GroupKey`
      The dimension(s) comprising the group.
      These may be a subset of all the dimensions in the DataSet, in which case all matching Observations are considered part of the 'group'—even if they are associated with different SeriesKeys.

      GroupKeys are often used to attach AttributeValues; see below.

:class:`.AttributeValue`
  Value (:attr:`.AttributeValue.value`) for a DataAttribute (:attr:`.AttributeValue.value_for`).

  May be attached to any of: DataSet, SeriesKey, GroupKey, or Observation.
  In the first three cases, the attachment means that the attribute applies to all Observations associated with the object.

Data structures
---------------

:class:`.Concept`, :class:`.ConceptScheme`
   An abstract idea or general notion, such as 'age' or 'country'.

   Concepts are one kind of Item, and are collected in an ItemScheme subclass called ConceptScheme.

:class:`.Dimension`, :class:`.DataAttribute`
   These are :class:`Components <.Component>` of a data structure, linking a Concept (:attr:`~.Component.concept_identity`) to its Representation (:attr:`~.Component.local_representation`); see below.

   A component can be either a DataAttribute that appears as an AttributeValue in data sets; or a Dimension that appears in Keys.

:class:`.Representation`, :class:`.Facet`
   For example: the concept 'country' can be represented as:

   - as a value of a certain type (e.g. 'Canada', a :class:`str`), called a Facet;
   - using a Code from a specific CodeList (e.g. 'CA'); multiple lists of codes are possible (e.g. 'CAN'). See below.

:class:`DataStructureDefinition <.BaseDataStructureDefinition>` (DSD)
   Collects structures used in data sets and data flows.
   These are stored as
   :attr:`~.BaseDataStructureDefinition.dimensions`,
   :attr:`~.BaseDataStructureDefinition.attributes`,
   :attr:`~.BaseDataStructureDefinition.group_dimensions`, and
   :attr:`DataStructureDefinition.measures <.v21.DataStructureDefinition.measures>`.

   For example, :attr:`~.BaseDataStructureDefinition.dimensions` is a :class:`.DimensionDescriptor` object that collects a number of Dimensions in a particular order.
   Data that is "structured by" this DSD must have all the described dimensions.

   See the API documentation for details.

Metadata
--------

:class:`.Code`, :class:`.Codelist`
   ...
:class:`.Category`, :class:`.CategoryScheme`, :class:`.Categorisation`
   Categories serve to classify or categorize things like data flows, e.g. by subject matter.

   A :class:`.Categorisation` links the thing to be categorized, e.g., a DataFlowDefinition, to a particular Category.

Constraints
-----------

:class:`.v21.Constraint`, :class:`.ContentConstraint`
   Classes that specify a subset of data or metadata to, for example, limit the contents of a data flow.

   A ContentConstraint may have:

   1. Zero or more :class:`.CubeRegion` stored at :attr:`~.v21.ContentConstraint.data_content_region`.
   2. Zero or one :class:`.DataKeySet` stored at :attr:`~.v21.Constraint.data_content_keys`.

   Currently, :meth:`.ContentConstraint.to_query_string`, used by :meth:`.Client.get` to validate keys based on a data flow definition, only uses :attr:`~.v21.ContentConstraint.data_content_region`, if any.
   :attr:`~.v21.Constraint.data_content_keys` are ignored.
   None of the data sources supported by :mod:`sdmx` appears to use this latter form.


.. _formats:

File formats
============

The IM provides terms and concepts for data and metadata, but does not specify how that (meta)data is stored or represented.
The SDMX standards include multiple formats for storing data, metadata, and structures.
In general, :mod:`sdmx`:

- Reads most SDMX-ML 2.1 and 3.0.0 and SDMX-JSON 1.0 messages.
- Uses collected specimens of messages in various formats, stored in the `khaeru/sdmx-test-data <https://github.com/khaeru/sdmx-test-data/>`_ Git repository.
  These are used by the test suite to check that the code functions as intended, but can also be viewed to understand the data formats.

SDMX-ML
-------

Reference: https://github.com/sdmx-twg/sdmx-ml

Based on eXtensible Markup Language (XML).
SDMX-ML can represent every class and property in the IM.

- An SDMX-ML document contains exactly one :class:`.Message`.
  See :mod:`sdmx.message` for the different classes of Messages and their attributes.
- See :mod:`.reader.xml.v21`, :mod:`.reader.xml.v30`, :mod:`.writer.xml`.

.. versionadded:: 2.11.0

   Support for reading SDMX-ML 3.0.0.

.. _sdmx-json:

SDMX-JSON
---------

Reference: https://github.com/sdmx-twg/sdmx-json

Based on JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).
The SDMX-JSON *format* is versioned differently from the overall SDMX *standard*:

- SDMX-JSON 1.0 corresponds to SDMX 2.1.
  It supports only data and not structures or metadata.
- SDMX-JSON 2.0.0 corresponds to SDMX 3.0.0.
  It adds support for structures.

- See :mod:`.reader.json`.

.. versionadded:: 0.5

   Support for reading SDMX-JSON 1.0.

.. _sdmx-csv:

SDMX-CSV
--------

Reference: https://github.com/sdmx-twg/sdmx-csv; see in particular the file `sdmx-csv-field-guide.md <https://github.com/sdmx-twg/sdmx-csv/blob/v2.0.0/data-message/docs/sdmx-csv-field-guide.md>`_.

Based on Comma-Separated Value (CSV).
The SDMX-CSV *format* is versioned differently from the overall SDMX *standard*:

- `SDMX-CSV 1.0 <https://github.com/sdmx-twg/sdmx-csv/tree/v1.0>`__ corresponds to SDMX 2.1.
  It supports only data and metadata, not structures.
  SDMX-CSV 1.0 files are recognizable by the header ``DATAFLOW`` in the first column of the first row.

  .. versionadded:: 2.9.0

     Support for *writing* SDMX-CSV 1.0.
     See :mod:`.writer.csv`.

  :mod:`sdmx` does not currently support *reading* SDMX-CSV 1.0.

- `SDMX-CSV 2.0.0 <https://github.com/sdmx-twg/sdmx-csv/tree/v2.0.0>`_ corresponds to SDMX 3.0.0.
  The format differs from and is not backwards compatible with SDMX-CSV 1.0.
  SDMX-CSV 2.0.0 files are recognizable by the header ``STRUCTURE`` in the first column of the first row.

  .. versionadded:: 2.19.0

     Initial support for *reading* SDMX-CSV 2.0.0.
     See :mod:`.reader.csv`.

  :mod:`sdmx` does not currently support *writing* SDMX-CSV 2.0.0.

.. _sdmx-rest:
.. _web-service:

SDMX-REST web service API
=========================

The SDMX standards describe both `RESTful <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer>`_ and `SOAP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP>`_ web service APIs.
:mod:`sdmx` does not support SDMX-SOAP, and no support is planned.

See :doc:`resources` for the SDMG Technical Working Group's specification of the REST API.
The help materials from many data providers—for instance, :ref:`ESTAT` and :ref:`ECB`—provide varying descriptions and examples of constructing query URLs and headers.
These generally elaborate the SDMX standards, but in some cases also document source-specific quirks and errata.

.. _sdmx-rest-versions:

The SDMX-REST *web service API* is versioned differently from the overall SDMX *standard*:

- SDMX-REST API v1.5.0 and earlier corresponding to SDMX 2.1 and earlier.
- SDMX-REST API v2.0.0 and later corresponding to SDMX 3.0.0 and later.

:mod:`sdmx` aims to support:

- SDMX-REST API versions in the 1.x series from v1.5.0 and later
- SDMX-REST API versions in the 2.x series from v2.1.0 and later.
- Data retrieved in SDMX 2.1 and 3.0.0 :ref:`formats <formats>`.
  Some existing services offer a parameter to select SDMX 2.1 *or* 2.0 format; :mod:`sdmx` does not support the latter.
  Other services *only* provide SDMX 2.0-formatted data; these cannot be used with :mod:`sdmx` (:ref:`see above <sdmx-version-policy>`).

:class:`.Client` constructs valid URLs using the :class:`~.rest.URL` subclasses :class:`.v21.URL` and :class:`.v30.URL`.

- For example, :meth:`.Client.get` automatically adds the HTTP header ``Accept: application/vnd.sdmx.structurespecificdata+xml;`` when a :py:`structure=...` argument is provided and the data source supports this content type.
- :class:`.v21.URL` supplies some default parameters in certain cases.
- Query parameters and headers can always be specified exactly via :meth:`.Client.get`.

:class:`Source <.sdmx.source.Source>` and its subclasses handle documented or well-known idiosyncrasies/quirks/errata of the web services operated by different agencies, such as:

- parameters or headers that are not supported, or must take very specific, non-standard values, or
- unusual ways of returning data.

See :ref:`data-source-limitations`, :doc:`sources`, and the source code for the details for each data source.
Please `open an issue`_ with reports of or information about data source–specific quirks that may be in scope for :mod:`sdmx` to handle, or a pull request to contribute code.
