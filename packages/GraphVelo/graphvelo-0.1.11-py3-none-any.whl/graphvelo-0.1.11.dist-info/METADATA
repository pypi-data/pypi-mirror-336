# GraphVelo allows for accurate inference of multimodal omics velocities and molecular mechanisms for single cells

[![Supported Python versions](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8-blue)](https://python.org)

**GraphVelo** is a graph-based machine learning procedure that uses RNA velocities inferred from existing methods as input and infers velocity vectors that lie in the tangent space of the low-dimensional manifold formed by the single-cell data.

## Key Features

- Refine the velocity vectors estimated by any methods (e.g., splicing-based, metabolic labeling-based, pseudotime-based, lineage tracing-based, etc.) to the data manifold
- Infer modality dynamics that go beyond splicing events
    - Transcription rate of genes without introns or undergoing alternative splicing
    - Change rate of chromatin openness
    - More to be explored
- Serve as a plugin that can be seamlessly integrated into existing RNA velocity analysis pipelines
- Analyze dynamical systems in the context of multi-modal single-cell data

## Getting Started with GraphVelo

Check the pipeline of RNA velocity estimation and you will find the niche of `graphvelo`:

Now let's get started with our [Tutorials](https://graphvelo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## Installation

You need to have Python 3.8 or newer installed on your system. 

To create and activate a new environment
```bash
conda create -n graphvelo python=3.8
conda activate graphvelo
```

Install via pip:
```bash
pip install graphvelo
```
