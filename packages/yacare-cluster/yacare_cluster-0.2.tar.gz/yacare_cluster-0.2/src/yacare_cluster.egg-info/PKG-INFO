# YACARE

This package implements the YACARE algorithm for clustering data. If you want to use it, please cite "Clustering data by reordering them" by Descamps et al.
This package is currently mainly empty, and we will upload it to PyPI once the paper is accepted for publication.
The paper will be upload to arXiv in March 2025.
