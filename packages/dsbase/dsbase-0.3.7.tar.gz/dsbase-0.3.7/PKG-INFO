# dsbase

This is a comprehensive utility library containing tools and helpers refined through years of practical Python development. It includes an advanced logging system, environment variable management, path handling, database interfaces, media processing tools, and various helpers for common tasks. It was originally developed for personal use, but always to high standards with quality and flexibility in mind.

Some of the features include:

- A custom `DSEnv` environment variable manager
- A custom `DSPaths` path manager
- A generalized singleton metaclass for use in other projects
- A simple diffing tool
- An argparse interface that makes it easier to set column widths
- An elegant and sophisticated `LocalLogger` logging system
- Database helper interfaces for MySQL and SQLite
- File helpers for comparing, copying, deleting, and listing files
- Fun loading animations
- Media helpers for audio and video transcoding with `ffmpeg`
- Simple classes that can send notifications via email or Telegram
- Simple helpers for progress indication, shell handling, and text manipulation
- Various time parsers and utilities

**NOTE:** This library is constantly evolving, and I would love for you to use it but I recommend pinning specific versions for now. I try to be careful about breaking changes in patch releases but there is still a lot of active development.
