Using swh-alter
===============

Services provided by this component are available through the ``swh alter`` command
line tool.

The key feature is available through the ``remove`` sub-command and allow
removal of data from the archive. Before this happens, a recovery bundle will be
created that allows reverting the operation.

Because of their potential sensitivity, data in recovery bundles is stored
encrypted. The system is designed so that extracting content or restoring from a
recovery bundle will require a pre-determined set of stakeholders to get
together before proceeding.

Dependencies
------------

``swh-alter`` requires the ``rage``, ``rage-keygen`` and optionally
``age-plugin-yubikey`` commands to be available in the ``PATH``.

See their respective documentation on how to install them:

- `rage installation <https://github.com/str4d/rage#installation>`_ (also provides ``rage-keygen``)
- `age-plugin-yubikey installation <https://github.com/str4d/age-plugin-yubikey#installation>`_

``age-plugin-yubikey`` also requires the ``pcscd`` service to be installed and
running. On Debian systems, the service is available from the package with the
same name.

.. _cli-config-alter:

Configuration
-------------

The tools will not work without a configuration file. It can be created as
``~/.config/swh/alter.yml`` containing for example:

See the :ref:`configuration reference <cli-config>` for general information
about the Software Heritage configuration file. ``storage``,
``restoration_storage`` and entries in the ``removal_storages`` map uses the
:ref:`storage configuration <cli-config-storage>`. For ``graph``, see the
:ref:`graph <cli-config-graph>` section. The entries in the ``removal_searches``
map are following the format defined by ``swh-search``. The entries in the
``removal_objstorages`` map are used by ``swh-objstorage``. Finally the entries
in the ``removal_journals`` map follow the :ref:`journal <cli-config-journal>`
format.

In most cases, multiple *storages* have to be configured:

- The ``storage`` section defines the storage from which information will be
  read. It is used to determine which objects can be removed from the
  archive and create recovery bundles. For the latter, it needs to be able to
  retrieve data from Content objects (through an *objstorage*).
- The ``restoration_storage`` section defines the storage which will be written
  to in case recovery bundles need to be restored. Usually, this should be the
  same configuration as used for *loaders*. Write access is required. For
  the restoration to fully work, it also needs to be configured to write to an
  *objstorage* and a *journal*.
- ``removal_storages`` contains storages (identified by an arbitrary key)
  from which objects will be removed (when using ``swh alter remove``).

Likewise, ``removal_objstorages`` and ``removal_journals`` defines *objstorages*
and *journals* from which data and messages will be removed by ``swh alter
remove``.

The ``graph`` section is used to determine which objects can be safely removed
from the archive.

In addition, the organization of the secret sharing process needs to be defined
in ``secret_sharing``.

.. note::

   The example above requires people from two groups to decrypt recovery
   bundles: the legal team and the system administration team. For the legal
   team, either the Data Protection Officer or the Chief Legal Officer will need
   to provide an identity file with their secret key. For system administrators,
   at least two of the specified YubiKeys will need to be present.

In the `groups` section, each group is keyed with an arbitrary identifier. In
each group:
- ``recipient_keys`` associate an identifier for the holder and an
`age`_ public key
- ``minimum_requred_shares`` set the threshold of holders required for this group.

The minimum amount of valid groups that are required to recover the decryption
key is set in ``minimum_required_groups``.

age public key can be created using the ``age-keygen`` or ``rage-keygen``
command (depending on your implementation), or by calling ``age-plugin-yubikey``
to store the private key on a `YubiKey`_.

When using YubiKeys, the secret holder identifier needs to be specified in the
form ``YubiKey serial ####### slot #``. The required numbers are visible in the
identity file created by ``age-plugin-yubikey`` or by running
``age-plugin-yubikey --list`` after plugging in the YubiKeys.

.. hint::

   When using YubiKeys, ``swh alter`` does not need any external files to be stored
   on the system. Connecting the right YubiKey is all that is required.

   Otherwise, the *age* secret key will need to be provided manually
   as an *identity file*. Such files should be stored with care.
   Being 74 characters long, *age* secret keys are fairly easy to archive on
   paper.

Removing objects from the archive
---------------------------------

``swh alter remove`` will remove a given set of origins, and any objects they
reference (as long as it not referenced elsewhere), from the archive.

.. code:: console

    $ export SWH_CONFIG_FILENAME=~/config/swh.alter.yml
    $ swh alter remove \
          --identifier "takedown-notice-2023-07-14-01" \
          --recovery-bundle tdn-2023-07-14-01.swh-recovery-bundle \
          https://gitlab.softwareheritage.org/swh/devel/swh-alter.git \
          https://gitlab.softwareheritage.org/swh/devel/swh-py-template.git

.. Sample output: [for reference, it does not appear in the documentation]

Objects will be removed from entries in ``removal_searches``,
``removal_storages``, ``removal_journals``, ``removal_objstorages`` defined in
the configuration.

If during the removal process a reference is added to one of the removed
objects, the process will be rolled back: the recovery bundle will be used to
restore objects as they were to ``restoration_storage``. This will also be the
case if any error happens during the process. The recovery bundle will be left
intact. The process can be retried using
``swh alter recovery-bundle resume-removal`` command, using the decryption key
printed on the output for this purpose.

Options:

``--dry-run``
    Get a list of objects that would be removed and exit.

``--identifier IDENTIFIER`` (required)
    An arbitrary identifier for this removal operation. Stored in recovery
    bundles.

``--recovery-bundle PATH`` (required)
    Location of the recovery bundle that will be created before removing objects
    from the archive.

``--reason REASON``
    Reason for this removal operation.

``--expire YYYY-MM-DD``
    Date when the recovery bundle should be removed.

Resuming a removal from a recovery bundle
-----------------------------------------

``swh alter recovery-bundle resume-removal`` will remove from the archive
all objects contained in a recovery bundle. This can be useful after
using ``swh alter remove --dry-run=stop-before-removal`` or in case
of failures from external resources during the removal operation.

.. code:: console

    $ swh alter recovery-bundle resume-removal tdn-2023-07-14-01.swh-recovery-bundle

A prompt will ask for the decryption key if it has not been specified via the
relevant environment variable or option.

Options:

``--decryption-key AGE_SECRET_KEY``
    Use the given decryption key to access the objects stored in the bundle.
    The environment variable ``SWH_BUNDLE_DECRYPTION_KEY`` can be used instead.

Restoring from a recovery bundle
--------------------------------

``swh alter recovery-bundle restore`` will restore all objects contained in a
recovery bundle to the storage defined in ``restoration_storage``. In order to
proceed, this command requires enough shared secrets to be recovered.
Alternatively, the bundle decryption key can be provided.

This command also requires the appropriate permissions needed to update Software
Heritage storage, journal and object storage.

.. code:: console

    $ swh alter recovery-bundle restore tdn-2023-07-14-01.swh-recovery-bundle

    Show raw manifest in YAML format.

``--show-encrypted-secrets``
    Show encrypted secrets for each share holder. This allows for out of band
    recovery of the shared secret by providing the encrypted payload to the
    secret holder (see also :ref:`recovery-bundle-remote-operations`).

Extracting content stored in a recovery bundle
----------------------------------------------

``swh alter recovery-bundle extract-content`` will extract data from a
Content object stored in a recovery bundle. In order to proceed, this command
requires enough shared secrets to be recovered. Alternatively, the bundle
decryption key can be provided.

See :ref:`recovery-bundle-info` on how to get a list of objects stored in
recovery bundle.

.. code:: console

    $ swh alter recovery-bundle extract-content \
          --output requirements.txt \
          tdn-2023-07-14-01.swh-recovery-bundle \
          swh:1:cnt:3d65be4c62d36aac611260b47555ac9d51cd5515

Options:

``--output PATH`` (required)
    Path of the file that will be written with the extracted content. ``-`` can
    be used to print the content to the standard output.

``--decryption-key AGE_SECRET_KEY``
    Use the given decryption key instead of the bundle shared secrets (see
    :ref:`recovery-bundle-remote-operations`).

``--secret MNEMONIC``
    Known shared secret. May be repeated.

``--identity IDENTITY``
    Path to an *age* identity file holding a secret key. May be repeated.

.. _recovery-bundle-remote-operations:

Operating recovery bundles remotely
-----------------------------------

Operations that require to decrypt objects from recovery bundle all offer a
``--decryption-key`` option. It can be used to directly provide the
age secret key that decrypts objects contained in the bundle.

This option enables remote operations. In the case not all secret share holders
can physically work on the same computer, or if the system having the right
permission to update the Software Heritage archive is only available remotely,
this decryption key can first be recovered in one or more separate steps.

``swh alter recovery-bundle recover-decryption-key`` will help to recover the
secret key protected by the shared secrets. It supports several situations:

- If all secret share holders can work on the same computer,
  then the decryption key can be recovered directly:

  .. code:: console

        $ swh alter recovery-bundle recover-decryption-key \
            --identity age-identity-dpo.txt \
            tdn-2023-07-14-01.swh-recovery-bundle

- If secret share holders are distributed, they will first need to
  separately recover their shared secret. For example, for the example
  configuration given above, the DPO would run:

  .. code:: console

        $ swh alter recovery-bundle recover-decryption-key \
            --show-recovered-secrets \

  It is also possible to decrypt the secret without requiring `swh-alter`. One
  can retrieve the encrypted payload of a shared secret holder by running:

  .. code:: console

        $ swh alter recovery-bundle info \
            --show-encrypted-secrets \
            tdn-2023-07-14-01.swh-recovery-bundle

  After receiving the encrypted payload, the DPO can then the following command
  on their own computer to recover their secret:

  .. code:: console

        $ rage --decrypt --identity age-identity-dpo.txt
        -----BEGIN AGE ENCRYPTED FILE-----

  The legal group only requires one secret, so this is enough. Meanwhile, two
  system administrators use their YubiKeys to recover the required amount of
  secrets for their group:

  The decryption key can then be recovered by providing these secrets:

  .. code:: console

            --secret "union echo acrobat easy […] crowd" \
            --secret "union echo beard entrance […] crowd" \

        🚸 The following secret shares will not be decrypted: DPO, CFO

        🔓 Recovered decryption key:
        AGE-SECRET-KEY-15PQHAGKV59TFK9TCCWLQZZ7XVV0FADVX5TSCDWVZSEWZ4L2SMARSJAAR0W

  .. note::

    The shared secrets should be 33 words long. They have been elided here for clarity.
    All shared secrets should have the same first two words. All shared secrets from
    a given group should also have same first third word.

It is possible to both provide shared secrets on the command line and use
identity files or YubiKeys for the missing ones. This applies to all commands
needing data stored in a bundle. For example:

.. code:: console

    $ swh alter recovery-bundle recover-decryption-key \
          --secret "union echo beard entrance […] crowd" \
          --secret "union echo beard email […] enforce" \
          --identity age-identity-dpo.txt \
          tdn-2023-07-14-01.swh-recovery-bundle

Options for ``swh alter recovery-bundle recover-decryption-key``:

``--secret MNEMONIC``
    Known shared secret. May be repeated.

``--identity IDENTITY``
    Path to an *age* identity file holding a secret key. May be repeated.

``--show-recovered-secrets``
    Show recovered shared secrets from YubiKeys are identity files.

Shared secrets rollover
-----------------------

``swh alter recovery-bundle rollover`` enables to switch existing recovery
bundle to a new secret sharing configuration. First, :ref:`configure the new
organization <cli-config-alter>`. Then, the command can be used as such:

.. code:: console

    $ swh alter recovery-bundle rollover \
          tdn-2023-07-14-01.swh-recovery-bundle \
          tdn-2023-08-15-01.swh-recovery-bundle

In order to proceed, this command requires enough shared secrets to be
recovered. Alternatively, when operating on a single bundle, the decryption key
can be provided. A confirmation will be required before proceeding as the
recovery bundles are updated in place.

Options:

``--decryption-key AGE_SECRET_KEY``
    Use the given decryption key instead of the bundle shared secrets (see
    :ref:`recovery-bundle-remote-operations`). If used, only one recovery bundle
    should be provided at time.

``--secret MNEMONIC``
    Known shared secret. May be repeated.

``--identity IDENTITY``
    Path to an *age* identity file holding a secret key. May be repeated.

For mirrors: watching and acting on removal notifications
---------------------------------------------------------

To implement the policy regarding :ref:`mirrors and takedown requests performed
on the main archive <mirror_takedown_requests>`, mirrors must run the
notification watcher.

This process will listen to the journal topic ``swh.journal.removal_notification``
for unprocessed removal notifications. When one arrives, it will create
a new request in the :ref:`masking proxy database <swh-storage-masking>`,
adding all removed SWHIDs listed in the notification with the state “*decision
pending*”. These objects will still be present on the mirror but not be
available to the public. An email will also be sent to the mirror operators to
notify that a new removal notification has arrived from the main archive.

Mirror operators then need to chose–in accordance with they policies and
legal/data protection department–between several options to handle the
notification: perform the removal on the mirror, mask the listed objects
permanently, dismiss the notification and lift the visibility restriction.

Configuration for the mirror notification watcher
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The mirror notification watcher needs a configuration file. It can contain the
same keys as the configuration required to perform removals. The minimum required
looks like the following:

.. code:: yaml

    journal_client:
      brokers: kafka.example.org:9092
      group_id: mirror-notification-watcher
      prefix: swh.journal
    storage:
      cls: remote
      url: https://storage-ro
    masking_admin:
      cls: postgresql
      db: service=masking-db-rw
    emails:
      from: swh-mirror@example.org
      recipients:
      - trinity@example.org
      - neo@example.org
    smtp:
      host: localhost
      port: 25

The ``journal_client`` map follows the :ref:`journal configuration
<cli-config-journal>` and defines how to access to the journal with the
``swh.journal.notification_removal`` topic.

The ``storage`` map follows the :ref:`storage configuration
<cli-config-storage>`. The storage is accessed read-only to perform
verifications on the received removal notifications.

The ``masking_admin`` map must contain the database connection class in ``cls``
(most probably ``postgresql``) and its DSN in ``db``.

The ``emails`` map defines the ``from`` address used to send emails, and the
addresses listed as ``recipients`` will be informed that a new removal
notification has arrived.

The ``smtp`` map defines the ``host`` and ``port`` of the SMTP relay used
to send emails.

Running the mirror notification watcher
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the mirror notification watcher, issue the following command:

.. code:: console

    $ swh alter run-mirror-notification-watcher

The process should not terminate under normal circumstances.

There is no additional command-line options.

Acting on a removal notification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each notification will have its own ”removal identifier”. This identifier will
be sent in the email received by mirror operators. To act on a removal
notification, operators need to decide–in accordance to their policies–between
three options:

a) Replicate the removal operation on the mirror. Objects will be
   deleted from the mirror. This command requires a configuration fully
   setup for removals, and also the ``masking_admin`` map.

   As it will create a recovery bundle (in case the operation needs to
   be reverted), the ``--recovery-bundle`` option needs to be set
   to the path where it will be created.

   An example command:

   .. code:: console

      $ swh alter handle-removal-notification remove \
            '20240525-example-identifier' \
            --recovery-bundle=20240525-example-identifier.swh-recovery-bundle

b) Permanently restrict the access of the objects removed from the main
   archive. They will not be deleted by they will not be available to
   the public anymore.

   The command would look like:

   .. code:: console

      $ swh alter handle-removal-notification restrict-permanently \
            '20240525-example-identifier'

c) Dismiss the notification. The access restriction on objects removed
   from the main archive will be lifted.

   To give an example of a command:

   .. code:: console

      $ swh alter handle-removal-notification dismiss \
            '20240525-example-identifier'
