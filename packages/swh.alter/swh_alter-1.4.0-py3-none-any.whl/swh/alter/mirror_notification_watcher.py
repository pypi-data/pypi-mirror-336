[Action needed] Removal from the main Software Heritage archive ({removal_identifier})\
"""

REMOVAL_NOTIFICATION_RECEIVED_EMAIL_BODY = """\
Hi!

Our mirror has received a notification that several objects were
removed from the main Software Heritage archive for the following reason:

{reason}

These objects have now been made inaccessible to the public until an action
is taken for their future on the mirror. Here are the list of objects
requested for removal:

{requested}

Number of removed objects broken down by object types:

- {origin}
- {snapshot}
- {release}
- {revision}
- {directory}
- {content}
- {raw_extrinsic_metadata}

🫵 You now need to decide between 3 options:
⚖️  Please consult your DPO/legal departement if needed.

a) Replicate the removal operation on the mirror. Objects will be
   deleted from the mirror. A recovery bundle will be created in
   case the operation needs to be reverted.

   Issue the following command:

       swh alter handle-removal-notification remove \\
         '{removal_identifier}' \\
         --recovery-bundle=/PATH/TO/RECOVERY_BUNDLE

b) Permanently restrict the access of the objects removed from the main
   archive. They will not be deleted by they will not be available to
   the public anymore.

   Issue the following command:

       swh alter handle-removal-notification restrict-permanently \\
         '{removal_identifier}'

c) Dismiss the notification. The access restriction on objects removed
   from the main archive will be lifted.

   Issue the following command:

       swh alter handle-removal-notification dismiss \\
         '{removal_identifier}'

Thank you,
