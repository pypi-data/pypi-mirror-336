# \brief A data type for the storage of mass percent compositions of chemical compounds.
# 
# <tt>MassComposition</tt> is an unique associative map where the keys specify the atom type (defined in namespace Chem.AtomType) of the chemical elements and the mapped floating-point values correspond to the percentage contribution of the elements to the total mass of the compound.
