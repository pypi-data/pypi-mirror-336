# \brief A class providing methods for the storage and lookup of control-parameter values.
# 
# The purpose of <tt>ControlParameterContainer</tt> is to provide a common facility for the storage and lookup of dynamic parameter values to subclasses which can be used to control their runtime-behaviour.
# 
# For the explicit assignment of control-parameter values the method setParameter() is provided which expects the key of the control-parameter as its first and the value to assign as the second argument. The availability of a value for a particular control-parameter can be tested by the method isParameterSet(). For the retrieval of control-parameter values the getParameter() family of overloaded methods is provided which expect the key of the control-parameter as an argument. The method getParameterOrDefault() additionally allows to specify a default value that gets returned if an entry for the requested control-parameter value does not exist. <tt>ControlParameterContainer</tt> guarantees that the complexity of these operations is never worse than logarithmic.
# 
# Control-parameter values are stored in an associative map as Base.LookupKey / Base.Any pairs of type ControlParameterContainer.ParameterEntry. The current number of entries can be queried with the method getNumParameters(). Iterators pointing to the beginning and end of the container are obtained via the methods getEntriesBegin() and getEntriesEnd(), respectively.
# 
# <tt>ControlParameterContainer</tt> allows for an arrangement of instances in a tree-like hierarchy where each non-root instance has exactly one parent and zero or more children. In such hierarchies, a child container forwards requests for control-parameter values to their parents if they do not contain a local entry for a given control-parameter. The parent container is set and detached by the method setParent(). A <tt>ControlParameterContainer</tt> instance automatically keeps track of any links from and to other instances in the hierarchy and detaches any parent or child containers on object destruction.
# 
# For the notification of client code about any changes that affect control-parameter values, the <tt>ControlParameterContainer</tt> interface provides three methods for the registration of callback functions:
#  - registerParameterChangedCallback() <br>
#  registers callback target functions that get invoked when the value of a control-parameter has changed
#  - registerParameterRemovedCallback() <br>
#  registers callback target functions that get invoked when a control-parameter entry has been removed
#  - and registerParentChangedCallback() <br>
#  is used to register callback target functions that get invoked when the parent container has been changed or was detached
# 
# Each of these methods returns a numeric identifier for the registered callback function. For callback unregistration purposes the methods unregisterParameterChangedCallback(), unregisterParameterRemovedCallback() and unregisterParentChangedCallback() are provided. These methods require the previously obtained numeric identifier of the callback to be passed as an argument.

    # If a parent container has been set and the argument <em>local</em> is <tt>False</tt>, the request is forwarded to the parent (which may also forward the request).
