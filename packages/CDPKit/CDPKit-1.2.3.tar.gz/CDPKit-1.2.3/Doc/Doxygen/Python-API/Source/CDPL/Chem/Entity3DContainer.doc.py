# \brief A common interface for data-structures that support a random access to stored Chem.Entity3D instances.
# 
# Implementations have to guarantee that a given Chem.Entity3D object is stored only once and its index is unique amongst all contained Chem.Entity3D instances. Otherwise algorithms that rely on this behaviour may not work correctly!
#

    ##
    # \brief Initializes the \e %Entity3DContainer instance.

    ##
    # \brief Returns a reference to the entity at index <em>idx</em>.
    # 
    # \param idx The zero-based index of the Chem.Entity3D instance to return.
    # 
    # \return A reference to the entity at the specified index.

    ##
    # \brief Returns the numeric identifier (ID) of the wrapped C++ class instance.
    # 
    # Different Python \c %Entity3DContainer instances may reference the same underlying C++ class instance. The commonly used Python expression
    # <tt>a is not b</tt> thus cannot tell reliably whether the two \c %Entity3DContainer instances \e a and \e b reference different C++ objects. 
    # The numeric identifier returned by this method allows to correctly implement such an identity test via the simple expression
    # <tt>a.getObjectID() != b.getObjectID()</tt>.
