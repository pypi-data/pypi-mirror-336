# \brief A class providing methods for the storage and lookup of object properties.
# 
# The purpose of <tt>PropertyContainer</tt> is to provide a common facility for the storage and lookup of dynamic object properties to subclasses and their clients.
# 
# <tt>PropertyContainer</tt> stores the properties in a map that associates unique property keys of type Base.LookupKey with corresponding property values of type Base.Any. Iterators pointing to the beginning and end of the property key/value pairs (see PropertyContainer.PropertyEntry) can be retrieved by the methods getPropertiesBegin() and getPropertiesEnd(), respectively. The number of currently stored property value entries is accessible via the method getNumProperties().
# 
# For the explicit assignment of property values the method setProperty() is provided which expects the key of the property as its first and the value to assign as the second argument. Whether the value of a particular property has been set can be tested by the method isPropertySet(). For the erasure of property values the methods removeProperty() and clearProperties() are provided. The first method clears the value of a single property while the latter method removes all assigned property values.
# 
# To access the value of a property, two types of getProperty() methods are available that both expect the key of the property as the first argument. The templated versions return the stored property value (or the specified default if not available) as a reference to an object of the specified template argument type. The non-template method returns the requested property value indirectly as a reference to the Base.Any instance storing the actual value. If the requested property value does not exist, an additional argument decides whether to throw an exception or to return an empty Base.Any instance.

    # The numeric identifier returned by this method allows to correctly implement such an identity test via the simple expression
    # <tt>a.getObjectID() != b.getObjectID()</tt>.
