    # The numeric identifier returned by this method allows to correctly implement such an identity test via the simple expression
    # <tt>a.getObjectID() != b.getObjectID()</tt>.

    # \brief Calculates the <em>BCUT</em> descriptor of the molecular graph <em>molgraph</em>.
    # 
    # The calculated <em>BCUT</em> descriptor is a vector that contains the calculated eigenvalues of the underlying <em>Burden</em> matrix [\ref BURMA]. The elements of the vector are sorted in ascending order. Note that explicit hydrogen atoms are included in the calculation of the <em>BCUT</em> descriptor. In order to calculate the descriptor for a hydrogen depleted molecular graph, any hydrogen atoms have to be removed from the molecular graph <em>before</em> the calculation is performed.

    # \param molgraph The molecular graph for which to calculate the <em>BCUT</em> descriptor.
    # \param descr The calculated <em>BCUT</em> descriptor.
