# \brief Specifies how to draw lines and outlines of shapes.
# 
# A pen has a line style, width, color, cap style and join style attribute. The line style specifies how a line will look like (solid, dashed, ...). The default line style is Pen.SOLID_LINE. Setting the line style to Pen.NO_LINE tells the renderer not to draw lines or outlines. The pen color defines the color of lines and text. The default line color is Color.BLACK. The cap style specifies how the end points of lines are drawn and the join style defines how the joins between two or more connected have to be drawn. The default cap style is Pen.ROUND_CAP and the default join style is Pen.ROUND_JOIN.
