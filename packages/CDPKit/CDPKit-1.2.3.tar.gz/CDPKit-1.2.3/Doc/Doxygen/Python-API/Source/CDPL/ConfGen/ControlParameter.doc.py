    # If the control-parameter is set to <tt>True</tt>, not only severe errors cause an I/O operation to fail, but also non-fatal errors from which a recovery would be possible. If the control-parameter is set to <tt>False</tt>, I/O operations will proceed even if a non-fatal error has been detected.
