    # 
    # Different Python \c %AutoCorrelation2DVectorCalculator instances may reference the same underlying C++ class instance. The commonly used Python expression
    # <tt>a is not b</tt> thus cannot tell reliably whether the two \c %AutoCorrelation2DVectorCalculator instances \e a and \e b reference different C++ objects.

    # <tt>a.getObjectID() != b.getObjectID()</tt>.

The size of the vector is limited by the topological diameter of the molecular graph or the specified maximum considered bond path length (\see setMaxDistance()).
