# \brief A common interface for data-structures that support a random access to stored Chem.Bond instances.

# Implementations have to guarantee that a given Chem.Bond object is stored only once and its index is unique amongst all contained Chem.Bond instances. Otherwise algorithms that rely on this behaviour may not work correctly!
