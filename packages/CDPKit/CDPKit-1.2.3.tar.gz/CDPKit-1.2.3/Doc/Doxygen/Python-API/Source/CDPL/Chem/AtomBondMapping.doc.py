# \brief A data structure for the common storage of related atom to atom and bond to bond mappings.
# 
# <tt>AtomBondMapping</tt> is used to represent arbitrary mappings between the atoms and bonds of two (or more) molecular graphs (e.g. results of a substructure search). The atom and bond mappings are stored in respective data members of type Chem.AtomMapping and Chem.BondMapping. They can be accessed by the provided getAtomMapping() and getBondMapping() family of overloaded methods.

    # 
    # Different Python \c %AtomBondMapping instances may reference the same underlying C++ class instance. The commonly used Python expression
    # <tt>a is not b</tt> thus cannot tell reliably whether the two \c %AtomBondMapping instances \e a and \e b reference different C++ objects. 
    # The numeric identifier returned by this method allows to correctly implement such an identity test via the simple expression
    # <tt>a.getObjectID() != b.getObjectID()</tt>.

    # \return The numeric ID of the internally referenced C++ class instance.
