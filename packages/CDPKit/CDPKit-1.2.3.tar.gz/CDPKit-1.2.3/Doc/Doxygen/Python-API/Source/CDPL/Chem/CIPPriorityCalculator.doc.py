    # \param priorities An array containing the calculated <em>CIP</em> priorities. The <em>CIP</em> priorities are stored in the same order as the atoms appear in the atom list of the molecular graph (i.e. the <em>CIP</em> priority of an atom is accessible via its index).

    # \brief Returns the numeric identifier (ID) of the wrapped C++ class instance.
    # 
    # Different Python \c %CIPPriorityCalculator instances may reference the same underlying C++ class instance. The commonly used Python expression
    # <tt>a is not b</tt> thus cannot tell reliably whether the two \c %CIPPriorityCalculator instances \e a and \e b reference different C++ objects. 
    # The numeric identifier returned by this method allows to correctly implement such an identity test via the simple expression
    # <tt>a.getObjectID() != b.getObjectID()</tt>.
    # 
    # \return The numeric ID of the internally referenced C++ class instance.
