# \brief Specifies the fill pattern and fill color of shapes.
# 
# A brush has a style and a color attribute. The style defines the look of the fill pattern and the color attribute specifies the color of the specified fill pattern. The style of a default constructed <tt>Brush</tt> object is Brush.NO_PATTERN, which tells the renderer not to fill drawn shapes.
