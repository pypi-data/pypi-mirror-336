    # Different Python \c %FeaturePairDistanceMatchFunctor instances may reference the same underlying C++ class instance. The commonly used Python expression
    # <tt>a is not b</tt> thus cannot tell reliably whether the two \c %FeaturePairDistanceMatchFunctor instances \e a and \e b reference different C++ objects. 
    # The numeric identifier returned by this method allows to correctly implement such an identity test via the simple expression
    # <tt>a.getObjectID() != b.getObjectID()</tt>.

    # \return The numeric ID of the internally referenced C++ class instance.
