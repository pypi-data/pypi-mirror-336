# \brief A data type for the storage of element histograms of chemical compounds.
# 
# <tt>ElementHistogram</tt> is an unique associative map where the keys specify the atom type (defined in namespace Chem.AtomType) of the chemical elements and the mapped integer values correspond to the element frequencies.

    # <tt>a is not b</tt> thus cannot tell reliably whether the two \c %ElementHistogram instances \e a and \e b reference different C++ objects. 
    # The numeric identifier returned by this method allows to correctly implement such an identity test via the simple expression
    # <tt>a.getObjectID() != b.getObjectID()</tt>.
    # 
    # \return The numeric ID of the internally referenced C++ class instance.
