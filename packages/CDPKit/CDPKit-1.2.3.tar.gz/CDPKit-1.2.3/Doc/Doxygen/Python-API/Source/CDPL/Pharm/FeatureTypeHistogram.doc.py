# \brief A data type for the storage of feature type histograms of pharmacophores.
# 
# <tt>FeatureTypeHistogram</tt> is an unique associative map where the keys specify the feature type (defined in namespace Pharm.FeatureType) of the pharmacophore features and the mapped integer values correspond to the feature type frequencies.

    # <tt>a is not b</tt> thus cannot tell reliably whether the two \c %FeatureTypeHistogram instances \e a and \e b reference different C++ objects. 
    # The numeric identifier returned by this method allows to correctly implement such an identity test via the simple expression
    # <tt>a.getObjectID() != b.getObjectID()</tt>.
