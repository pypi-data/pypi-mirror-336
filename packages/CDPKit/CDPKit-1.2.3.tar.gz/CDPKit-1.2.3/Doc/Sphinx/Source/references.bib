abstract = {Abstract A Gaussian description of molecular shape is used to compare the shapes of two molecules by analytically optimizing their volume intersection. The method is applied to predict the relative orientation of ligand series binding to the proteins, thrombin, HIV protease, and thermolysin. The method is also used to quantify the degree of chirality of asymmetric molecules and to investigate the chirality of biphenyl and the amino acids. The shape comparison method uses the newly described shape multipoles that can also be used to describe the inherent shape of molecules. Some results of calculated shape quadrupoles are given for the ligands used in this work. © 1996 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {Abstract This article introduces MMFF94, the initial published version of the Merck molecular force field (MMFF). It describes the objectives set for MMFF, the form it takes, and the range of systems to which it applies. This study also outlines the methodology employed in parameterizing MMFF94 and summarizes its performance in reproducing computational and experimental data. Though similar to MM3 in some respects, MMFF94 differs in ways intended to facilitate application to condensed-phase processes in molecular-dynamics simulations. Indeed, MMFF94 seeks to achieve MM3-like accuracy for small molecules in a combined “organic/protein” force field that is equally applicable to proteins and other systems of biological significance. A second distinguishing feature is that the core portion of MMFF94 has primarily been derived from high-quality computational data—ca. 500 molecular structures optimized at the HF/6-31G* level, 475 structures optimized at the MP2/6-31G* level, 380 MP2/6-31G* structures evaluated at a defined approximation to the MP4SDQ/TZP level, and 1450 structures partly derived from MP2/6-31G* geometries and evaluated at the MP2/TZP level. A third distinguishing feature is that MMFF94 has been parameterized for a wide variety of chemical systems of interest to organic and medicial chemists, including many that feature frequently occurring combinations of functional groups for which little, if any, useful experimental data are available. The methodology used in parameterizing MMFF94 represents a fourth distinguishing feature. Rather than using the common “functional group” approach, nearly all MMFF parameters have been determined in a mutually consistent fashion from the full set of available computational data. MMFF94 reproduces the computational data used in its parameterization very well. In addition, MMFF94 reproduces experimental bond lengths (0.014 Å root mean square [rms]), bond angles (1.2° rms), vibrational frequencies (61 cm−1 rms), conformational energies (0.38 kcal/mol/rms), and rotational barriers (0.39 kcal/mol rms) very nearly as well as does MM3 for comparable systems. MMFF94 also describes intermolecular interactions in hydrogen-bonded systems in a way that closely parallels that given by the highly regarded OPLS force field. © 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

ABSTRACT = {The accurate prediction of molecular properties, such as lipophilicity and aqueous solubility, are of great importance and pose challenges in several stages of the drug discovery pipeline. Machine learning methods, such as graph-based neural networks (GNNs), have shown exceptionally good performance in predicting these properties. In this work, we introduce a novel GNN architecture, called directed edge graph isomorphism network (D-GIN). It is composed of two distinct sub-architectures (D-MPNN, GIN) and achieves an improvement in accuracy over its sub-architectures employing various learning, and featurization strategies. We argue that combining models with different key aspects help make graph neural networks deeper and simultaneously increase their predictive power. Furthermore, we address current limitations in assessment of deep-learning models, namely, comparison of single training run performance metrics, and offer a more robust solution.},

ABSTRACT = {Pharmacophores are an established concept for the modelling of ligand–receptor interactions based on the abstract representations of stereoelectronic molecular features. They became widely popular as filters for the fast virtual screening of large compound libraries. A lot of effort has been put into the development of sophisticated algorithms and strategies to increase the computational efficiency of the screening process. However, hardly any focus has been put on the development of automated procedures that optimise pharmacophores towards higher discriminatory power, which still has to be done manually by a human expert. In the age of machine learning, the researcher has become the decision-maker at the top level, outsourcing analysis tasks and recurrent work to advanced algorithms and automation workflows. Here, we propose an algorithm for the automated selection of features driving pharmacophore model quality using SAR information extracted from validated QPhAR models. By integrating the developed method into an end-to-end workflow, we present a fully automated method that is able to derive best-quality pharmacophores from a given input dataset. Finally, we show how the QPhAR-generated models can be used to guide the researcher with insights regarding (un-)favourable interactions for compounds of interest.},

abstract={QSAR methods are widely applied in the drug discovery process, both in the hit‐to‐lead and lead optimization phase, as well as in the drug-approval process. Most QSAR algorithms are limited to using molecules as input and disregard pharmacophores or pharmacophoric features entirely. However, due to the high level of abstraction, pharmacophore representations provide some advantageous properties for building quantitative SAR models. The abstract depiction of molecular interactions avoids a bias towards overrepresented functional groups in small datasets. Furthermore, a well‐crafted quantitative pharmacophore model can generalise to underrepresented or even missing molecular features in the training set by using pharmacophoric interaction patterns only. This paper presents a novel method to construct quantitative pharmacophore models and demonstrates its applicability and robustness on more than 250 diverse datasets. fivefold cross-validation on these datasets with default settings yielded an average RMSE of 0.62, with an average standard deviation of 0.18. Additional cross-validation studies on datasets with 15--20 training samples showed that robust quantitative pharmacophore models could be obtained. These low requirements for dataset sizes render quantitative pharmacophores a viable go-tomethod for medicinal chemists, especially in the lead-optimisation stage of drug discovery projects.},
