         * Describes a Sp3 tetrahedral centre using a "focus" (the central atom) and
         * four "carrier" (the neighbours of the central atom). 
         *
         * The arrangement of these atoms is described as left or right handed. This is the
         * ordering of the carries (c[1],c[2],c[3]) looking from the first carrier
         * (c[0]). For example in the diagram below if the bond from f to c[0] was a
         * bold wedge (pointing towards the viewer) the neighbours would be ordered
         * clockwise:
         *
         *           c[3]
         *           |
         *           |
         *   c[2] -- f -=# c[0]
         *           |
         *           |
         *           c[1]
         *
         *  Up/Bold wedge, c[1..3] are clockwise/right-handed.
         *
         * If the bond was a hashed wedged (pointing towards the viewer) the ordering
         * is now left-handed.
         *
         *           c[3]
         *           |
         *           |
         *   c[2] -- f ... c[0]
         *           |
         *           |
         *           c[1]
         *
         *  Down/Hashed wedge, c[1..3] are anti-clockwise/left-handed.
         *
         * Note - If one of the carriers is a hydrogen or lone pair you can re-use
         * the focus as a placeholder in the carriers:
         *
         *           f
         *           |
         *           |
         *   c[2] -- f ... c[0]
         *           |
         *           |
         *           c[1]
         *
         *  Down/Hashed wedge, {c[1..2],f} are anti-clockwise/left-handed.
