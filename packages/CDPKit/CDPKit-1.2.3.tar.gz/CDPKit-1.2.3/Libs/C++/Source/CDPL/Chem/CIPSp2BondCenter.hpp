         * This configurations is used to describe the cis-trans specification of an
         * Sp2 bond. 
         *
         * It described in terms of two foci (the atoms of the double bond)
         * and two carries (each attached to either atom). The arrangement of the
         * carriers can either be OPPOSITE (trans) or TOGETHER (cis).
         * Importantly carrier[0] should be bonded to foci[0] and carrier[1] to
         * foci[1]. If there are additional atoms bonded they should be ignored, it
         * does not matter which atom is ignored as the labeler will inspect the
         * molecule and flip the labelling if needed. The bond is provided as to where
         * the label should be set.
