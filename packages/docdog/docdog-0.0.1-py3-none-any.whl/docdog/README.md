## Overview/Introduction
docdog is a tool that utilizes AI to generate documentation for projects. It chunks files, summarizes code, and creates README files based on the provided code summaries. By automating the documentation process, docdog aims to streamline project management and enhance developer productivity. The tool integrates with the OpenAI API for code summarization and offers a range of functionalities for processing project files efficiently.

## Features
- Chunks files from a project root directory into multiple text files
- Summarizes code chunks using the OpenAI API
- Generates README content based on code summaries
- Supports parallel processing of code chunks for faster summarization
- Provides configuration files for customizing tool behavior
- Utilizes the GPT-3.5-turbo model for generating summaries

## Installation
To install docdog, use the following command:
```
pip install docdog
```
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies such as openai, python-dotenv, and pykomodo installed. 

## Usage
1. Chunk files from project root directory:
```python
# Example Python code for chunking files
def chunk_files(directory):
    return chunked_files
```

2. Summarize code chunks using the OpenAI API:
```python
# Example Python code for code summarization
def summarize_code_chunk(code_chunk):
    return summary
```

3. Generate README content from code summaries:
```python
# Example Python code for generating README content
def generate_readme(summaries):
    return readme_content
```

## Configuration
docdog provides configuration options to customize its behavior. You can set environment variables and adjust settings for verbose logging and maximum workers. Refer to the configuration files for detailed customization options.

## Examples and Use Cases
1. Chunking Files:
```python
# Chunk files from project root directory
chunked_files = chunk_files('project_directory')
```

2. Code Summarization:
```python
# Summarize code chunks using the OpenAI API
summary = summarize_code_chunk(code_chunk)
```

## Troubleshooting/FAQ
If you encounter issues with chunking or code summarization, ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed and configured correctly. Refer to the documentation for troubleshooting tips.
