## Overview/Introduction

NLP App is a command-line tool for performing various natural language processing (NLP) tasks on text data. It provides a user-friendly interface for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. The project aims to make NLP techniques accessible to users without extensive knowledge of the underlying algorithms.

## Features

- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization)
- Part-of-speech (POS) tagging
- Named entity recognition (NER)
- Sentiment analysis
- Topic modeling (LDA)
- Command-line interface (CLI) for easy usage
- Support for multiple input file formats (txt, csv, json)
- Customizable configuration options

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/nlp-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd nlp-app
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start Guide

After installation, you can run the NLP App from the command line:

```bash
python nlp_app.py --input_file data/sample.txt --tasks pos ner
```

This command will perform part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition on the `sample.txt` file located in the `data` directory.

## Usage

The NLP App supports various tasks and options. You can view the available options by running:

```bash
python nlp_app.py --help
```

### Examples

- Perform sentiment analysis on a JSON file:

```bash
python nlp_app.py --input_file data/reviews.json --tasks sentiment
```

- Perform topic modeling (LDA) on a CSV file:

```bash
python nlp_app.py --input_file data/articles.csv --tasks lda --num_topics 10
```

- Preprocess text and save the output to a file:

```bash
python nlp_app.py --input_file data/corpus.txt --tasks preprocess --output_file preprocessed.txt
```

## API Documentation

The NLP App provides a Python API for integrating NLP functionality into your projects. The main classes and functions are:

- `TextPreprocessor`: Handles text preprocessing tasks (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization).
- `POSTagger`: Performs part-of-speech tagging on tokenized text.
- `NERTagger`: Identifies named entities in text using pre-trained models.
- `SentimentAnalyzer`: Analyzes the sentiment of text data (positive, negative, or neutral).
- `TopicModeler`: Discovers topics and their distributions in a corpus of documents using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

For detailed usage and examples, refer to the [API documentation](https://github.com/username/nlp-app/blob/main/docs/api.md).

## Configuration

The NLP App can be configured using a JSON file or environment variables. The following options are available:

- `preprocessing.stopwords`: Path to a custom stopwords file (default: `None`, uses built-in stopwords).
- `preprocessing.stemmer`: Stemming algorithm to use (`porter`, `snowball`, or `None` for no stemming).
- `ner.model`: Pre-trained NER model to use (default: `en_core_web_sm`).
- `sentiment.model`: Pre-trained sentiment analysis model to use (default: `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`).
- `lda.num_topics`: Number of topics for LDA topic modeling (default: `10`).

You can create a `config.json` file in the project root directory or set the corresponding environment variables (e.g., `NLP_APP_PREPROCESSING_STOPWORDS`).

## Examples and Use Cases

The NLP App can be used in various scenarios, such as:

- **Text analysis**: Analyze large text corpora (e.g., customer reviews, social media posts, news articles) to extract insights and understand trends.
- **Content categorization**: Categorize documents based on topics or sentiment for better organization and retrieval.
- **Text preprocessing**: Preprocess text data for downstream NLP tasks, such as machine translation or text generation.
- **Named entity recognition**: Identify and extract named entities (e.g., people, organizations, locations) from text for information extraction and data mining.

Here's an example of using the NLP App for sentiment analysis on customer reviews:

```python
from nlp_app.sentiment import SentimentAnalyzer

# Load customer reviews from a file
with open('data/reviews.txt', 'r') as f:
    reviews = f.readlines()

# Initialize the SentimentAnalyzer
analyzer = SentimentAnalyzer()

# Analyze sentiment for each review
for review in reviews:
    sentiment, score = analyzer.analyze(review)
    print(f"Review: {review.strip()}")
    print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment} (Score: {score:.2f})")
    print()
```

## Troubleshooting/FAQ

**Q: I'm getting an error during installation related to missing dependencies.**
A: Make sure you have the required system packages installed. On Ubuntu/Debian, you can install them with `sudo apt-get install build-essential python3-dev`.

**Q: How can I use a custom trained model for named entity recognition?**
A: You can load a custom spaCy model by setting the `ner.model` configuration option to the path of your model.

**Q: How do I handle large text files that don't fit in memory?**
A: The NLP App supports processing text files in chunks using the `--chunk_size` option. This will read and process the input file in smaller chunks to prevent memory issues.
