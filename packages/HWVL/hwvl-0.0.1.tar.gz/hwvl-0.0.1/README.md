# HWVL Hash
HWVL Hash stands for "Hash with Variable Length."

Before we delve into explaining this algorithm, let's examine the characteristics of a hash.

# Main Features of Hash Algorithms

- The output length of a hash function or hash value is always fixed.
- As long as the input remains unchanged, the output of the hash function is deterministic and constant.
- The hash value is usually much smaller than the input. For this reason, hash functions are also referred to as compressors.
- The operation of a hash function differs from that of encryption.
- Hash functions are designed to be one-way.

# Innovation in Security
Our hash introduces an innovation in the world of security, as it takes two inputs in contrast to other algorithms, which are:

- The text we want to hash
- The length of the output

Increasing the output length slows down the process but enhances security; the larger this number, the lower the probability of the hash being compromised.
