    Get available nodes grouped and sorted by descending block_id

    Each entry is a list of nodes (HeadV2 instance, inline endpoint list) sharing the same block_id:

        [
            [{"head": HeadV2, "endpoints": [str, ...]}, ...],
            [{"head": HeadV2, "endpoints": [str, ...]}, ...],
            ...
        ]

    You can just select the first endpoint of the first node of the first group to quickly get an available node.

        groups = get_available_nodes(client)
        first_node_first_endpoint = groups[0][0]["endpoints"][0]

    If node is down, you can select another node.

    Warning: only nodes with BMAS, BASIC_MERKLED_API, and GVA endpoint are selected
              and only those endpoints are available in the endpoint list
