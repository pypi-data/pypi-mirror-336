
# NOTE: Version 2 Improvements
    # Introduced the SPEAR class, storing local variables instead of utilizing functions
    # Massively improved computational effecientcy
    # Better improved modularity, and client-side customization
    # Improved simplicity and ease-of-use
    # (actually works well)
    # Officially supports simple multithreading
    # So much more, a complete rehaul from V1, utilize this version above V1 (V1 is very rough and unlikely to work propertly)
