## About dopo

The **Premise Validation Project** introduces the Python package `dopo`
(**D**etecting **O**utliers in **P**remise **O**perations), a toolkit 
for evaluating the consistency of background life cycle inventories and 
identifying anomalies that could affect LCA results.

It is essentially a wrapper around the [Brightway2](https://brightway.dev/) ``bw2analyzer`` library,
combined with a Dash web application for interactive exploration of datasets and results.

## ðŸ§ª Features

- Detect structural and numerical outliers in ecoinvent-based inventories.
- Interface with Brightway2 and Premise-modified databases.
- Filter or classify activities based on CPC, ISIC, or custom sector definitions.
- Assess differences in environmental impacts from method-to-method or database-to-database.

---

## ðŸ“Š Dash Web Application

`dopo` includes a Dash-based interactive app for exploring datasets and visualizing environmental impact scores across projects.

### App Features

- âœ… Load and switch between multiple Brightway projects
- âœ… Select one or more background databases
- âœ… Choose a dataset grouping: **Sectors**, **CPC**, or **ISIC**
- âœ… Filter datasets with a search bar
- âœ… (Optional) Exclude market activities using a checkbox
- âœ… Select one or more impact assessment methods
- âœ… View either total impact scores or contribution plots
- âœ… Interactive dropdowns to explore results by sector and method
- âœ… Run calculations and visualize scores in seconds

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to install ``dopo`` in a Python environment with `brightway` (2 or 2.5).

You can install _dopo_ via from Anaconda:

```console
$ conda install romainsacchi::dopo
```

Or via [pip] from [PyPI]:

```console
$ pip install dopo
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For Mac users with an ARM chip, you need to have `scikit-umfpack` 
> as well as `numpy<=1.24.4`, otherwise it results in slow calculations.
> This is not specific to `dopo` but to `brightway` in general.

### How to run the app

You can launch the app directly from the terminal using the following command:

```bash
dopo-dash
```
