# Spotify Web Sockets
[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/spotify-ws)](https://pepy.tech/project/spotify-ws)

## Description

The main purpose of this project is to let the users interact with
spotify web socket events. Right now the project is still in an alpha version therefore is not complete and may have some bugs.
Feel free to contribute is any way.

_DISCLAIMER:_
This library only works with a valid spotify premium subscription

## Basic library usage

Example using chrome cookies

```python

from spotifyws.spotify import SpotifyWs

client = SpotifyWs()

# Triggered on track change
@client.on('track')
def on_track_change(data):
    print('Track changed => ', data)

# Triggered on volume change
@client.on("volume")
def on_volume_change(data):
    print("Volume changed => ", data)

# Triggered on options change, such as shuffle etc.
@client.on("playback_options")
def on_playback_options_change(data):
    print("Options changed => ", data)

# Triggered playback state is resumed
@client.on("resume")
def on_play():
    print("Playback resumed")

# Triggered playback state is paused
@client.on("pause")
def on_pause():
    print("Playback paused")

```

Example using cookies from custom file

```python

from spotifyws.spotify import SpotifyWs

client = SpotifyWs(cookie_file="./cookie_file.json")

# Triggered on track change
@client.on('track')
def on_track_change(data):
    print('Track changed => ', data)

# Triggered on volume change
@client.on("volume")
def on_volume_change(data):
    print("Volume changed => ", data)

# Triggered on options change, such as shuffle etc.
@client.on("playback_options")
def on_playback_options_change(data):
    print("Options changed => ", data)

# Triggered playback state is resumed
@client.on("resume")
def on_play():
    print("Playback resumed")

# Triggered playback state is paused
@client.on("pause")
def on_pause():
    print("Playback paused")

```

You can also send playback and volume commands to clients

```python

from spotifyws.spotify import SpotifyWs

client = SpotifyWs()

client.send_command("pause")
client.send_command("resume")
client.send_command("skip_next")
client.send_command("skip_prev")
client.send_command("volume", 30000)
client.send_command("seek_to", 5000)

```

## Launch flask example

In order to launch flask example you need the following commands:

First install the library package from pypi

```bash
$ pip3 install spotify-ws
```

Then cd into the examples folder

```bash
$ cd examples/flask-app
```

Now before launching the server.py you need to retrieve the client-id
and the client-secret from your spotify dashboard panel; you can find
it [here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).

Copy paste client-id and client-secret in the respective variables.

Now you're ready to launch the server using the following command

```bash
$ python3 server.py
```

## About authentication

Right now authentication can only be achieved using local cookies and not through OAUTH flow.

## Note

This code is intended for learning purposes only.
You must know that bypassing spotify API is against theirs Terms of service therefore I don't invite you to abuse this library.
Thanks
