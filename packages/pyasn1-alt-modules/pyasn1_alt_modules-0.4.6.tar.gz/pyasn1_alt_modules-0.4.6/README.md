Alternative ASN.1 modules for pyasn1

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyasn1-alt-modules.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://pypi.org/project/pyasn1-alt-modules)
[![Python Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pyasn1-alt-modules.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pyasn1-alt-modules/)

The `pyasn1-alt-modules` package contains a collection of
[ASN.1](https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&id=T-REC-X.208-198811-W!!PDF-E&type=items)
data structures expressed as Python classes based on [pyasn1](https://github.com/etingof/pyasn1)
data model. Maintenance of pyasn1 has shifted to [pyasn1-maint](https://github.com/pyasn1/pyasn1).

It seems that [pyasn1-modules](https://github.com/etingof/pyasn1-modules) is no
longer being maintained.  As a result, the `pyasn1-alt-modules` package was
created to share new module developments.  Previous modules are included in
the `pyasn1-alt-modules` package so that both do not need to be installed.

However, the tools directory of the `pyasn1-modules` package is not included.

If ASN.1 module you need is not present in this collection, try using
[Asn1ate](https://github.com/kimgr/asn1ate) tool that compiles (some)
ASN.1 modules into pyasn1 code.
