## Getting Started

### Usage

#### Configuring Claude Desktop

You can run it with `uvx run hanzo-mcp` without installation. Configure Claude Desktop to use this server by adding the following to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hanzo": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "hanzo-mcp",
        "hanzo-mcp",
        "--allow-path",
        "/path/to/your/project"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Make sure to replace `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path to the project you want Claude to access.

#### Advanced Configuration Options

You can customize the server using other options:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hanzo": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "hanzo-mcp",
        "hanzo-mcp",
        "--allow-path",
        "/path/to/project",
        "--name",
        "custom-hanzo",
        "--transport",
        "stdio"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuring Claude Desktop System Prompt

To get the best experience with Hanzo MCP, you need to add the provided system prompt to your Claude Desktop client. This system prompt guides Claude through a structured workflow for interacting with Hanzo platform services and managing project files.

Follow these steps:

1. Locate the system prompt file in this repository at `doc/system_prompt`
2. Open your Claude Desktop client
3. Create a new project or open an existing one
4. Navigate to the "Project instructions" section in the Claude Desktop sidebar
5. Copy the contents of `doc/system_prompt` and paste it into the "Project instructions" section
6. Replace `{project_path}` with the actual absolute path to your project

The system prompt provides Claude with:

- A structured workflow for analyzing and modifying code
- Best practices for project exploration and analysis
- Guidelines for development, refactoring, and quality assurance
- Special formatting instructions for mathematical content

This step is crucial as it enables Claude to follow a consistent approach when helping you with code modifications.

## Security

This implementation follows best practices for securing access to your filesystem:

- Permission prompts for file modifications and command execution
- Restricted access to specified directories only
- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper error handling and reporting

## Development

To contribute to this project:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
