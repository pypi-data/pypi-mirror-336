# Missing Tests for Future Implementation

## API Client Testing
- **Test API Authentication Methods**: Add tests for different authentication methods (API keys, tokens, OAuth) with the REST API.
- **Test API Rate Limiting**: Tests to verify correct behavior when API rate limits are encountered.
- **Test API Error Recovery**: Tests for automatic retries and error handling when API connections fail.
- **Test API Client Performance**: Benchmark tests for API client performance under load.

## Patching Functionality
- **LLM Framework Version Compatibility Tests**: Tests to ensure compatibility with specific versions of each LLM framework.
- **Testing with Real LLM Frameworks**: Integration tests using real LLM framework instances (not mocks).
- **Dynamic Patching Tests**: Tests for runtime patching and unpatching functionality.
- **Framework Discovery Tests**: Tests for automatic discovery and patching of frameworks in the environment.

## Event Processing
- **Complex Event Pipeline Tests**: Tests for complex event processing pipelines with multiple transformations.
- **Event Batching Tests**: Tests for event batching and bulk sending to API.
- **Event Priority Handling**: Tests for handling events with different priority levels.
- **Event Processors Performance**: Performance tests for event processors under high load.

## Security Testing
- **Content Filtering Tests**: Comprehensive tests for the content filtering system.
- **PII Detection Tests**: Tests for personally identifiable information (PII) detection in events.
- **Security Alert Escalation Tests**: Tests for the alert escalation system.
- **Prompt Injection Attack Tests**: Tests for detecting and preventing prompt injection attacks.
- **Sanitization Tests**: Tests for data sanitization in various contexts.

## Integration Testing
- **Multi-Framework Integration Tests**: Tests that combine multiple LLM frameworks simultaneously.
- **End-to-End System Tests**: Full system tests from LLM call through to API reporting.
- **Long-Running Stability Tests**: Tests for stability in long-running environments.
- **Cross-Platform Tests**: Tests on different operating systems and environments.

## Regression Tests
- **Edge Case Tests**: Tests for edge cases in content handling.
- **Unusual Data Format Tests**: Tests for handling unusual or malformed data.
- **Backward Compatibility Tests**: Ensure new versions maintain compatibility with older clients.

## Monitoring Tests
- **Monitoring Overhead Tests**: Tests to measure and minimize monitoring performance impact.
- **Monitoring Accuracy Tests**: Tests to ensure all events are properly captured and nothing is missed.
- **Real-Time Monitoring Tests**: Tests for real-time event streaming and processing.

## Configuration Tests
- **Remote Configuration Tests**: Tests for dynamic configuration updates from the API.
- **Configuration Override Tests**: Tests for local configuration overrides.
- **Environment Variable Tests**: Tests for environment variable configuration.

These tests will ensure the system is robust, secure, and performs well in various environments and under different conditions as we continue to evolve the product.
