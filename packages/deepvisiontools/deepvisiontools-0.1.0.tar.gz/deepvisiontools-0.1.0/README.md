## Citations

deepvisiontools provide models wrapper that allow you to use differents models with all machinery available. It is the resposability of the user to cite properly the actual model developpers.
In particular, if using one of these models : Yolo, SMP please cite the actual models developpers (which are not deepvisiontools). For instance for Yolo, please cite ultralytics (https://www.ultralytics.com/) or for SMP cite https://github.com/qubvel-org/segmentation_models.pytorch  
Similar stands for other models.
