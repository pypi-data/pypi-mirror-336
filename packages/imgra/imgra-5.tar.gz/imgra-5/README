IMGRA: Image Processing With Graphs
===================================

This is destined to be like imscript, but for functions defined on graphs.
See an example nobetook here: http://dev.ipol.im/~coco/demoimgra.html

Most of the code is independent of images, and works for functions defined on
the vertices of arbitrary graphs.  Image processing is a particular case when
the graph in question is a grid-graph.

The best documentation is the code on file imgra.py

You can open it as a notebook if you have jupytext.

Available as "pip install imgra"

Run "imgra.demo()" to see the Poisson editing demo.
