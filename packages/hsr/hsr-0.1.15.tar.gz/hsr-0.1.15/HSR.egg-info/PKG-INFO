# Hypershape recognition (HSR): a general framework for moment-based similarity measures

 HSR is a versatile, moment-based similarity measure tailored for three-dimensional (3D) chemical representations annotated with atomic features. It enhances the robustness and versatility of the Ultrafast Shape Recognition (USR) method by incorporating multidimensional features for each atom, such as protons, neutrons, and formal charges.

## Getting Started

### Installing HSR

You can install HSR using either pip or conda:

```bash
pip install hsr
```
or 

```bash
conda install hsr -c conda-forge
```

### Build from source

Clone this repository on your machine. Move inside it and create the conda environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate HSR_devel
```
Verify the correct creation of the environment by running:

```bash
pytest
```
To use HSR from CLI you can run:
```bash
python -m hsr.hsr_cli 
```
If HSR is installed with pip or conda, the above command is replace by the simple use of ``hsr``

### Basic Usage

Run the folowing command to get help in using HSR from CLI:

```bash
hsr -h
```
