# Quick Start

T3CO-Go is a web-dashboard for running NREL's Transportation Technology Total Cost of Ownership (T3CO) tool in a userfriendly manner. There are two primary modes of using T3CO_Go:

- Run T3CO tool: provides full access to T3CO's capabilities and the ability to modify input assumptions
- Visualize Existing Results: allows users to upload a CSV results file from a prior T3CO run to get insights using different visualization methods

For further information on TCO inputs and methodologies, visit the official T3CO documentation site: <https://nrel.github.io/T3CO/>
