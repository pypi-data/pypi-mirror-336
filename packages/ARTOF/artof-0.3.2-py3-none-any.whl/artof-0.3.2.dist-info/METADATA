# ARTOF
The ARTOF package is a tool to read, process and analyze data collected from angle resolved time of flight (ARTOF) sensors.

## Getting started
To use this package python version >=3.10 is needed. The installation can be done using the command:
```bash
pip install ARTOF
```

## Documentation
The documenation can be found [here](https://artof-42d889.pages.hzdr.de/main/). It is automatically generated from the docstrings in all python classes.

## Workflow
The implementation of a new feature should be conducted as follows:
1. Create a new branch with a sensible name as a fork from `dev`.
2. Implement features including documentation.
3. If required, make changes to the Sphinx documenation under `docs/source/`.
4. Check if all excisting tests are still working (cmd: `pytest`) and write new test functions using.
5. If there were changes to `dev` since the initial fork, merge it into your branch and resolve conflicts.
6. Increase version number in `setup.cfg` file.
7. Push all changes to the remote repository and create a merge request to `dev`.
8. Make sure all tests succeed in the pipeline and merge.
9. When enough changes accumulate, create a merge request to `main` once enough features accumulated to roll out a new version. Make again sure all test pipelines succeed.
10. After merging to `main` a new version of the package is released to PyPi upon a successful pipeline run.

## Issues and new features
Issues and new feature requests can be added [here](https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/carl.meier/artof/-/issues).

## Development version
A version with features under development is available under the TestPyPi repository and can be installed as followed:
```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ ARTOF
```
The documentation can be found [here](https://artof-42d889.pages.hzdr.de/dev/).
