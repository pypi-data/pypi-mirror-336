   `RIDE (Robot Framework
   IDE) <https://github.com/robotframework/RIDE/>`__ v2.1.1 is a new
   release with some enhancements and bug fixes. The reference for valid
   arguments is `Robot Framework <https://robotframework.org/>`__
   installed version, which is at this moment 7.1.1. However, internal
   library code is originally based on version 3.1.2, but adapted for
   new versions.

   -  This version supports Python 3.8 up to 3.13.
   -  There are some changes, or known issues:

      -  üêû - When upgrading RIDE and activate Restart, some errors are
         visible about missing /language file, and behaviour is not
         normal. Better to close RIDE and start a new instance.
      -  üêû - Problems with COPY/PASTE in Text Editor have been reported
         when using wxPython 4.2.0, but not with version 4.2.1 and
         4.2.2, which we now *recommend*.
      -  üêû - Some argument types detection (and colorization) is not
         correct in Grid Editor.
      -  üêû - RIDE **DOES NOT KEEP** Test Suites formatting or
         structure, causing differences in files when used on other IDE
         or Editors. The option to not reformat the file is not working.

   **New Features and Fixes Highlights**

   -  Fixed long arguments in fixtures appearing splitted in Grid
      Editor. Still, arguments info will not be correct at calling
      step.
   -  Fixed double action on Linux when pressing the DEL key

   **The minimal wxPython version is, 4.0.7, and RIDE supports the
   current version, 4.2.2, which we recommend.**

   *Linux users are advised to install first wxPython from .whl package
   at*
   `wxPython.org <https://extras.wxpython.org/wxPython4/extras/linux/gtk3/>`__,
   or by using the system package manager.
