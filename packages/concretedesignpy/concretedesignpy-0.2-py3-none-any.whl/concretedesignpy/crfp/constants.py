def eRF(exposure: str, fiber_type: str) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the Environmental Reduction Factor (eRF) for Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP)
    materials based on the exposure condition and fiber type, following ACI 440 guidelines.

    Parameters
    ----------
    exposure : str
        Exposure environment. Accepted values: 'interior', 'exterior', or 'aggressive'.
    fiber_type : str
        Type of fiber used in the FRP. Accepted values: 'carbon', 'glass', or 'aramid'.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The environmental reduction factor for the specified exposure and fiber type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the exposure condition or fiber type is not recognized.
