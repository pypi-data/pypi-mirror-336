The aim of the application is to run a command in the terminal to create a project folder with everything you need for a back-end project in Python.

The current key commands are:
 ```bash
backgen --help
```
 ```bash
backgen create-project {name_of_project}
```
 ```bash
backgen generate-doc
```
 ```bash
backgen lint-code
```
 ```bash
backgen security-check
```
At the moment we're only in the testing phase, I'm working on the project solo, but if you want to join me, no worries :)
This is just a first version, I have lots of ideas for future additions.
