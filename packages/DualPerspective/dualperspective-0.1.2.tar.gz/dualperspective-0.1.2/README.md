# DualPerspective Python Package

Python interface for [DualPerspective.jl](https://github.com/MPF-Optimization-Laboratory/DualPerspective.jl), a Julia package for solving large-scale KL divergence problems.

## Installation

```bash
pip install DualPerspective
```

The package will automatically:
1. Install Julia if not already installed (via juliacall)
2. Install the DualPerspective.jl Julia package
3. Perform precompilation to ensure fast performance from the first run

## Usage

```python
import numpy as np
from DualPerspective import DPModel, solve, regularize

# Generate sample data
np.random.seed(42)
n = 200  # dimension of solution
m = 100  # number of measurements
x0 = np.random.rand(n)
x0 = np.pi * x0 / np.sum(x0)  # Rescale to sum to pi
A = np.random.rand(m, n)
b = A @ x0

# Create and solve the problem
model = DPModel(A, b)
regularize(model, 1e-4)  # Optional: set regularization parameter
solution = solve(model)

print(f"Sum of solution: {np.sum(solution):.6f} (should be â‰ˆ {np.pi:.6f})")
print(f"Optimal solution shape: {solution.shape}")
```

## Reinstalling the DualPerspective.jl package

To reinstall or update the DualPerspective.jl package, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install --force-reinstall DualPerspective
```

## Performance Considerations

This Python interface uses Julia's precompilation features to ensure good performance from the first run. The first import of the package may take slightly longer as it sets up the Julia environment, but subsequent operations should be fast.

## Features

- Easy-to-use Python interface for DualPerspective.jl
- Automatic installation of Julia dependencies
- Support for large-scale KL divergence problems
- Integration with NumPy arrays
- Precompilation for consistent performance

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- juliacall

## Advanced Usage

### Reinstalling the Julia Package

If you need to update the underlying Julia package to the latest version from the repository, you can use the following command:

```python
from DualPerspective.core import _reinstall_dualperspective
_reinstall_dualperspective()
```

This will pull the latest version of DualPerspective.jl from the GitHub repository and reinstall it in your Julia environment. This can be useful for:
- Getting the latest bugfixes
- Testing new features before they're included in an official Python package release
- Troubleshooting version compatibility issues

Note: While this function has a leading underscore (indicating it's "private"), it's documented here for users who need this functionality.

## Development

### Building and Publishing the Package

Follow these steps to build and publish new versions of the package to PyPI:

#### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the necessary tools:

```bash
pip install --upgrade build twine
```

#### Building the Package

Build both wheel and source distributions:

```bash
python -m build
```

This creates distribution files in the `dist/` directory.

#### Testing Locally

Before publishing, test the package locally:

```bash
# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Or install the built wheel
pip install dist/DualPerspective-0.1.1-py3-none-any.whl
```

#### Publishing to TestPyPI (Optional)

To test the publishing process:

```bash
twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*

# Install from TestPyPI
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ DualPerspective
```

#### Publishing to PyPI

Once tested and ready:

```bash
twine upload dist/*
```

#### Updating for New Releases

1. Update the version number in `pyproject.toml`
2. Make code changes
3. Rebuild: `python -m build`
4. Upload: `twine upload dist/*`
