Welcome to UTSP Client's documentation!
=======================================
This is a client library for accessing the universal time series provider (UTSP) server that works as a distributed job manager for time series generation tools.
It includes examples on how to use the UTSP to distribute many HiSIM calculation or several LPG evaluations, collect and filter the results, or even analyse them.

   Forschungszentrum Jülich IEK-3 Team

We are the `Institute of Energy and Climate Research - Techno-economic Systems Analysis (IEK-3) <https://www.fz-juelich.de/iek/iek-3/DE/Home/home_node.html>`_ belonging to the `Forschungszentrum Jülich <https://www.fz-juelich.de>`_. Our interdisciplinary institute's research is focusing on energy-related process and systems analyses. Data searches and system simulations are used to determine energy and mass balances, as well as to evaluate performance, emissions and costs of energy systems. The results are used for performing comparative assessment studies between the various systems. Our current priorities include the development of energy strategies, in accordance with the German Federal Government’s greenhouse gas reduction targets, by designing new infrastructures for sustainable and secure energy supply chains and by conducting cost analysis studies for integrating new technologies into future energy market frameworks. We are owners of the repository and set up the UTSP server as well as the REST client library.
