# Universal Time Series Provider Client

This is a client library for accessing the universal time series provider (UTSP) server that works as a distributed job manager for time series generation tools.
Look into the examples folder for several usage examples.
 
## Notes

Every request contains a guid string. This can be whatever you want. This guid is part of a caching mechanism and can be used to enforce recalculation of an otherwhise identical request. This might be interesting if the respective provider has probabilistic components. So if you want a fresh profile every time, set a different guid every time.

We are the <a href="https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/iek/iek-3">Institute of Energy and Climate Research - Techno-economic Systems Analysis (IEK-3)</a> belonging to the <a href="https://www.fz-juelich.de/en">Forschungszentrum Jülich</a>. Our interdisciplinary department's research is focusing on energy-related process and systems analyses. Data searches and system simulations are used to determine energy and mass balances, as well as to evaluate performance, emissions and costs of energy systems. The results are used for performing comparative assessment studies between the various systems. Our current priorities include the development of energy strategies, in accordance with the German Federal Government’s greenhouse gas reduction targets, by designing new infrastructures for sustainable and secure energy supply chains and by conducting cost analysis studies for integrating new technologies into future energy market frameworks.
