"""
This example shows how to add a new provider image to the UTSP server.

Strictly speaking, this script sends a tar file containing the build context
for a docker image to the server, so that the server builds the new provider
image. This is done because the build context is usually significantly smaller
than the built docker image file.

In order to create a build context of a provider, simply create a .tar file
containing everything that is needed to build the docker image, including sources
and Dockerfile. Usually this is simply the full repository of the software.
The .tar file can optionally be compressed via gzip and sent as a .tar.gz file.
