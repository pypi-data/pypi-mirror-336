# MaDDG (Maneuver Detection Data Generation)

<p align="center">A library for simulating high-fidelity observations of satellite trajectories with configurable maneuvers and custom sensor networks.</p>

MaDDG provides a simple interface for modeling complex observation scenarios. It allows you to create a satellite in any geocentric orbit, propagate its motion with a robust physical model, and track its position through optical sensors with customizable locations, observing limits, and noise parameters.

Through its use of [hydra-zen](https://github.com/mit-ll-responsible-ai/hydra-zen) and the [submitit plugin](https://hydra.cc/docs/plugins/submitit_launcher/), MaDDG can easily configure an array of simulation scenarios and distribute them in a SLURM cluster, empowering users to create large-scale, realistic datasets for training reliable maneuver detection and characterization models.

## Installation

MaDDG is available on PyPI:

```console
pip install MaDDG
```

To install from source, clone this repository and run the following
command from its top-level directory:

```console
pip install -e .
```

If you want to modify the orbit propagation physics behind MaDDG, you
will likely need to edit the [AstroForge](https://github.com/mit-ll/AstroForge) library, as well. AstroForge is
an open-source astrodynamics library and a key requirement of MaDDG. See
the [AstroForge documentation](https://astroforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for installation instructions.

## Usage

For details on how to use the various features of MaDDG, we recommend following the Jupyter notebooks in the `examples/` directory.

## Post Processing Scripts

### Weather Event (Cloud Dropout)

Use `dropout.py` to apply pseudo weather-based data dropout to dataset .csv files created with `hz_launcher.py`.

```
$ python scripts/dropout.py --help
usage: dropout.py [-h] --path PATH [--cloud_prob CLOUD_PROB] [--cloud_duration_mean CLOUD_DURATION_MEAN] [--cloud_duration_std CLOUD_DURATION_STD] [--num_runs NUM_RUNS]
                  [--save_copy_of_original] [--save_plots] [--submitit]

Script description

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --path PATH           The path to the input data file (.csv) (default: None)
  --cloud_prob CLOUD_PROB
                        Probability of a cloud event blocking the sky during 
                        any nighttime observable window for each sensor (default: 0.5)
  --cloud_duration_mean CLOUD_DURATION_MEAN
                        Mean duration of a cloud event (seconds) (default: 10800.0)
  --cloud_duration_std CLOUD_DURATION_STD
                        Standard deviation of a cloud event (seconds) (default: 3600.0)
  --num_runs NUM_RUNS   Number of dropout datasets to generate (default: 1)
  --save_copy_of_original
                        Raise this flag to save copy of the original input data along 
                        side of the modified dataset with dropouts (default: False)
  --save_plots          Raise this flag to generate and save plots (default: False)
  --submitit            Raise this flag to use submitit to launch jobs across multiple 
                        nodes in parallel (default: False)
```
