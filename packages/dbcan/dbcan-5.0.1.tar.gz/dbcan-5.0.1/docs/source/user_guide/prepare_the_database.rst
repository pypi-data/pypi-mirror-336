Database Installation Command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. We provide command in the run_dbcan script:

.. code-block:: shell

    run_dbcan database --db_dir db

2. Users could also download all  database files from the dbCAN2 website (http://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN2/download/Databases/), and then put them into the db directory.
   We use one file as an example here, users could download all files in the same way.

.. code-block:: shell

    mkdir db
    cd db
    wget https://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN2/download/run_dbCAN_database_total/CAZy.dmnd

.. _example folder: https://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN2/download/test
