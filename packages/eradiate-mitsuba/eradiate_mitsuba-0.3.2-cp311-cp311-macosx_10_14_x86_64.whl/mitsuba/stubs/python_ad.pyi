class Adam(Optimizer):
    """
        Implements the Adam optimizer presented in the paper *Adam: A Method for
        Stochastic Optimization* by Kingman and Ba, ICLR 2015.
    
        When optimizing many variables (e.g. a high resolution texture) with
        momentum enabled, it may be beneficial to restrict state and variable
        updates to the entries that received nonzero gradients in the current
        iteration (``mask_updates=True``).
        In the context of differentiable Monte Carlo simulations, many of those
        variables may not be observed at each iteration, e.g. when a surface is
        not visible from the current camera. Gradients for unobserved variables
        will remain at zero by default.
        If we do not take special care, at each new iteration:
    
        1. Momentum accumulated at previous iterations (potentially very noisy)
           will keep being applied to the variable.
        2. The optimizer's state will be updated to incorporate ``gradient = 0``,
           even though it is not an actual gradient value but rather lack of one.
    
        Enabling ``mask_updates`` avoids these two issues. This is similar to
        `PyTorch's SparseAdam optimizer <https://pytorch.org/docs/1.9.0/generated/torch.optim.SparseAdam.html>`_.

        It consists in computing a latent variable u = (I + λL) v from the vertex
        positions v, where L is the (combinatorial) Laplacian matrix of the input
        mesh. Optimizing these variables instead of the vertex positions allows to
        diffuse gradients on the surface, which helps fight their sparsity.
    
        This class builds the system matrix (I + λL) for a given mesh and hyper
        parameter λ, and computes its Cholesky factorization.
    
        It can then convert vertex coordinates back and forth between their
        cartesian and differential representations. Both transformations are
        differentiable, meshes can therefore be optimized by using the differential
        form as a latent variable.
