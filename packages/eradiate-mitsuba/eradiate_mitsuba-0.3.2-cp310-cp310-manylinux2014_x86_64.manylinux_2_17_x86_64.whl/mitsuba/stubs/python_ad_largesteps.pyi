class LargeSteps:
    """
        Implementation of the algorithm described in the paper "Large Steps in
        Inverse Rendering of Geometry" (Nicolet et al. 2021).
    
        It consists in computing a latent variable u = (I + λL) v from the vertex
        positions v, where L is the (combinatorial) Laplacian matrix of the input
        mesh. Optimizing these variables instead of the vertex positions allows to
        diffuse gradients on the surface, which helps fight their sparsity.
    
        This class builds the system matrix (I + λL) for a given mesh and hyper
        parameter λ, and computes its Cholesky factorization.
    
        It can then convert vertex coordinates back and forth between their
        cartesian and differential representations. Both transformations are
        differentiable, meshes can therefore be optimized by using the differential
        form as a latent variable.

        Convert differential coordinates back to their cartesian form: v = (I +

        This is done by solving the linear system (I + λL) v = u using the
        previously computed Cholesky factorization.
        
        This method is typically called at each iteration of the optimization,
        to update the mesh coordinates before rendering.
