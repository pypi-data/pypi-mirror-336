# gofannon  
  
**gofannon** is a collection of tools designed to enhance the capabilities of function-calling-enabled language models. These tools provide additional functionality for various tasks, including mathematical operations, GitHub interactions, arXiv searches, and advanced reasoning techniques.  

## Why the name `gofanon` ?

See [`why_the_name_gofannon.md`](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/gofannon/about/the_name_gofannon/) for the rich story on why we chose to honor this Celtic Diety

## Our Mission

We aim to achieve:

### Cross-Framework Compatibility
We solve the "vendor lock-in" problem in AI tooling through:
- Standardized interface definitions
- Automatic schema translation
- Bidirectional conversion tools

### Open Source Education
We make AI development accessible by:
- Curated contribution pathways
- Interactive documentation
- Pair programming sessions
- Weekly office hours

### Encouraging First-Time Contributors
We actively support new contributors through:
- Beginner-friendly issues
- Clear documentation and guides
- Supportuve community engagement

## Features  
  
- **Basic Math Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.  
- **GitHub Integration**: Interact with GitHub repositories, including creating issues, committing files, and retrieving repository contents.  
- **arXiv Search**: Search for and retrieve articles from arXiv.  
- **Advanced Reasoning**: Utilize Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning techniques for complex problem-solving.  
- **NHTSA Complaints**: Retrieve vehicle complaint data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  
  
## Roadmap  
  
For a detailed overview of planned features and their current status, please refer to the [ROADMAP](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/gofannon/blob/main/ROADMAP.md).   

## Documentation
