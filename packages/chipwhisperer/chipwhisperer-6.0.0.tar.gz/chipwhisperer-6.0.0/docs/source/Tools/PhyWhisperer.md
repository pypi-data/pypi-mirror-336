# PhyWhisperer-USB

The PhyWhisperer is a trigger for fault injection or side channel analysis which triggers
on the USB PHY. It's also capable of performing basic USB sniffing.

* Hardware sniffing, including error detection and cycle accurate timestamps
* Programmable cycle accurate offset for trigger
* Easy to use Python API
* Fully open source, plus spare room on FPGA means you can extend its functionality
* Built in shunt resistor for power analysis
    * Requires external measurement tool (ChipWhisperer, oscilloscope)
* Target power control for easy resets when glitching
    * Target power control via Python API and via button on device

## Controlling the PhyWhisperer

Similar to the ChipWhisperer platform, the PhyWhisperer can be controlled via a Python API. 
The API has its own ReadTheDocs page: [https://phywhispererusb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://phywhispererusb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This page also documents the software install process, including driver installation. 

The PhyWhisperer Github page also has a few example Jupyter notebooks showcasing the Python API, located in `software/jupyter/`.

### Reprogramming the PhyWhisperer


Both the FPGA and SAM3U have debug headers accessible on the PCB, as well as ROM resident bootloaders, accessible over USB. Usage of the ROM resident bootloaders is documented on the [PhyWhisperer ReadTheDocs](https://phywhispererusb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html) page. The SAM3U is most easily erased through the Python API, but can also be erased by shorting
SJ1, which is located on the back of the board.
### Connections

#### USB

In total, the PhyWhisperer has 3 USB connections:

1. 1 USB-A female connector for connecting to the target device
1. 1 Micro-USB for connecting to the host device
1. 1 Micro-USB for connecting to a control PC. 

#### I/O

This PhyWhisperer also has a [ChipWhisperer 20-pin connector](../Capture/20-pin-connector.md) for easy connection
to other NewAE products, as well as a digital IO header connected to the
PhyWhisperer's FPGA. Its pinout is as follows:

| Number | Name | Description |
|----------|-----|-----------|
| 1 | VCCIO | FPGA IO Voltage (3.3V) |
| 2 | VCCIO | |
| 3 | USERIO CLK | FPGA Clock |
| 4 | GND | Ground |
| 5 | USERIO D7 | FPGA Data 7 |
| 6 | GND | Ground |
| 7 | USERIO D6 | FPGA Data 6 |
| 8 | GND | Ground |
| 9 | USERIO D5 | FPGA Data 5 |
| 10 | GND | Ground |
| 11 | USERIO D4 | FPGA Data 4 |
| 12 | GND | Ground |
| 13 | USERIO D3 | FPGA Data 3 |
| 14 | GND | Ground |
| 15 | USERIO D2 | FPGA Data 2 |
| 16 | GND | Ground |
| 17 | USERIO D1 | FPGA Data 1 |
| 18 | GND | Ground |
| 19 | USERIO D0 | FPGA Data 0 |
| 20 | GND | Ground |

In addition, there are trigger out and shunt out connections next to the digital I/O header.

#### Debug

Two separate debug headers, one for the ATSAM3U microcontroller and one for the FPGA, are accessible with the case open.
They are located on J6 and J10, respectively, in 10-pin Cortex Debug.

#### Jumper Pins

The PhyWhisperer has one set of jumper pins used modifying power supplied to the target. Typical
configurations are:

1. Pins 4 and 6 connected: Shunt resistor bypassed
1. Pins 3 and 4 connected, pins 5 and 6 connected: Shunt resistor active

Capacitance to ground (2.2uF x2) is provided on pin 1. Pins 2 and 4 are connected internally.
Pins 3 and 5 are connected internally.
