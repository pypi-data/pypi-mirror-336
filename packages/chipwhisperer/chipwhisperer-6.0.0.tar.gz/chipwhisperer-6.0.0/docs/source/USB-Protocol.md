# ChipWhisperer USB Protocol

[Useful reading](https://www.beyondlogic.org/usbnutshell/usb1.shtml).

## Basic Overview

USB stuff is handled in `usb.c`. `main_setup_out_received()` handles OUT setup packets,
while `main_setup_in_received()` handles IN setup packets. 

Both functions select different commands based on the USB `bRequest` field. OUT packet
commands are handled in a callback, while IN packet commands are handled directly
in `main_setup_in_received()`.

Depending on the command, `wValue` and/or `payload` may be used as command parameters.

If the SAM3U is unable to process the setup packet (aka either `setup_*_received()` returns `false`)
you'll get a pipe error on the Python side.

## ChipWhisperer-Lite

### Setup OUT Commands

#### 0x10: REQ_MEMREAD_BULK


Setup a bulk IN transfer to read from the FPGA. This command must be sent before 
attempting to read from the bulk endpoint. An additional bulk transfer is not
setup upon this one completing, meaning this command must be called again
to do another bulk read.

##### wValue

Unused

##### payload 

* Bytes 0-3: Length of data to read from FPGA
* Bytes 4-7: FPGA Address to read from

___

#### 0x11: REQ_MEMWRITE_BULK

Setup a bulk OUT transfer to write to the FPGA. This command must be sent
before attempting to write to the bulk endpoint.

##### wValue

Unused

##### payload 

* Bytes 0-3: Unused
* Bytes 4-7: FPGA Address to write to

___

#### 0x12: REQ_MEMREAD_CTRL

`bRequest` will read data off the FPGA once this command has been called.

##### wValue

Unused
