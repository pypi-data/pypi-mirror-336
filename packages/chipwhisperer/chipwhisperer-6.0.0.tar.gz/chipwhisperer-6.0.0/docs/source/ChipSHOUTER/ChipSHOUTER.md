# CW520 ChipSHOUTER

The CW520 (ChipSHOUTER) is a fully-featured Electromagnetic Fault  Injection  platform  that  can  be  used  to  discover  and  characterize vulnerabilities in embedded systems. ChipSHOUTER    makes   EMFI   available   to   test   labs,   engineering   development firms, educators, and embedded enthusiasts. With a flexible API and bundled practice targets the system is a platform for experimentation and education right out of the box. Paired with an X-Y table and some basic python scripting  the  ChipSHOUTER  becomes  a  fully  automatable  EMFI  platform capable of precision testing and fault characterization.

## **SAFETY INFORMATION**

The ChipSHOUTER generates large voltages and electromagnetic fields that can be hazardous to human health and
can cause nearby devices to malfunction. Carefully read the safety sections in the ChipSHOUTER manual, available
on the [ChipSHOUTER github](https://github.com/newaetech/ChipSHOUTER/raw/master/documentation/ChipSHOUTER%20User%20Manual.pdf) before use.

## Product Highlights

* High side coil drive means the tip isn't connected directly to the 
high voltage capacitor bank, reducing shock risk
* Sophisticated fault detection system helps ensure user safety
and prevents damage to the device
* Basic and pulse output patterns
* Low latency hardware trigger allows easy interface with other devices
with triggering mechanisms, such as oscilloscopes or the ChipWhisperer platform
* Serial interface with Python API allows easy automation of glitch insertion
* Variety of fault injection tips available
