# CW1173 ChipWhisperer-Lite

The ChipWhisperer-Lite represents NewAE Technology Inc.’s most aggressive pursuit of it’s mission to bring side-channel power analysis and glitching attacks to every engineer and student. The FULLY open-source (hardware, software, 
firmware, FPGA code) is launching a revolution in hardware security. In particular, the ChipWhisperer-Lite
serves as a good middle ground between the full feature-set of the ChipWhisperer-Pro, and the affordability of
the ChipWhisperer-Nano.

The ChipWhisperer-Lite typically comes with two main parts: a
multi-purpose power analysis capture instrument, and a target board. The
target board is a standard microcontroller which you can implement
algorithms onto. For example if you wish to evaluate an AES library, you
can program that library into the target board and perform the power
analysis. 

**NOTE:** This page will only cover the capture side of the board. See
`targets/CW303` for documentation on the target side of the board.

## Quick-Start Guide

Hardware setup is fast and easy! If you've got a 1-part ChipWhisperer, simply use a
micro USB cable to connect the ChipWhisperer-Lite to a computer or laptop. If you've got a 2 part version,
you'll also need to connect a 20-pin cable between the ChipWhisperer-Lite and the target, as well
as a coax cable between the measure SMA connector (if you're doing power analysis) or the glitch 
SMA connector (if you're doing voltage glitching) and the SMA connector on the target. 
For other targets, check the relevant target documentation.

Once that's done, follow our {doc}`installation guide <../installation>`, which
will take the rest of the way towards learning about side channel attacks!

## Using the ChipWhisperer-Lite

All communication with the ChipWhisperer-Lite is done through ChipWhisperer's Python
API, which is documented on our {ref}`Scope API <api-scope>` page.

ChipWhisperer also has many Jupyter Notebook tutorials/labs, which serve as learning material for side-channel
attacks, as well as examples on how to use the ChipWhisperer API. If you followed the 
{doc}`installation instructions <../installation>`,
this will be in the `jupyter/` folder in the place you installed ChipWhisperer.

We also have full courses available at https://learn.chipwhisperer.io/ that supplement
the Jupyter Notebook tutorials.

---
### Using from Other Languages

While the ChipWhisperer API is written in Python, any language that can talk to libusb should be
compatible. This will require you to write your own backend and is officially unsupported
by NewAE.

---
### Connectors

#### **Glitch Port**

  The "Glitch" port is used for voltage glitching. It's connected to two
  MOSFET elements, as the following figure shows:

  ![image](Images/Glitch.png "image")

  The CW1173 glitch output can be commanded to turn on either of those
  MOSFETs via `scope.io.glitch_hp` and `scope.io.glitch_lp` fields:

```python

  scope.io.glitch_hp = True #enable high power glitch
  scope.io.glitch_hp = False #disable high power glitch

  scope.io.glitch_lp = True #enable low power glitch
  scope.io.glitch_lp = False #disable low power glitch
```

  Be careful using this feature, as you don't want to short the MOSFETs
  for too long. It's also possible to damage the ChipWhisperer-Pro by
  burning these MOSFETs up if used incorrectly. See [Fault101 Voltage Glitch Labs](https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer-jupyter/blob/main/courses/fault101/SOLN_Fault%202_1%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Voltage%20Glitching.ipynb)
  for more information.

---

#### **Measure Port**

  The "Measure" port is the input to the low-noise amplifier and ADC.

--- 

#### **20-Pin Connector**

The 20-pin connector is documented [here](20-pin-connector.md).

---
### Advanced Usage

#### **Serial Port**

Beginning with firmware 0.30 (released with ChipWhisperer 5.5), the ChipWhisperer-Lite
enumerates as both a custom USB device, as with previous firmware, as well as a USB CDC serial port. 

This new serial port allows you to use a serial client, such as Tera Term or PuTTY, to send and
receive USART data on the ChipWhisperer in the same way target module is normally used. These two
USART methods can be used individually, or both at the same time, though we recommend that you
don't send messages on both at the same time.

For more information, please read our [serial port page](../Serial%20Ports.md).

This new serial port has a few advantages:

* Periodic polling by the OS means dropped RX data should be rare
* The RX buffer on the OS means reading serial data costs almost no program time
    - With the cw target module, reading serial data, for example, slows down a capture loop
* Can send/receive serial data using either Python, or a serial client (though not both at the same time)

As well as a few disadvantages:

* Need to keep track of a serial port (/dev/ttyACMX or COMX) if not using pyserial
    - In addition, old versions of PySerial don't allow us to associate 

#### **Mounting Jumpers**

The ChipWhisperer-Lite main board and target section contain a
number of jumper options. By default these are not mounted, and solder
jumper bridges on the PCB have been bridged to select the appropriate
options when required. Some options are only solder jumpers, 
requiring a soldering iron to bridge or clear the appropriate connections.

The following lists jumpers on the ChipWhisperer-Lite Capture Section:

  - JP4 is the "RESET" net for the SAM3U processor.

  - JP2 causes the SAM3U processor flash memory to be erased. When the chip is erased a rom-resident bootloader takes over (see [](#erase-pins) for details).
  - JP5 selects the IO voltage for the FPGA bank which connects to the
    20-pin target. By default SJ6 selects this to be 3.3V. It is not
    recommended to change this, as it is easy to damage the FPGA by
    feeding an out-of-range voltage in.
  - SJ1 selects if the power supply comes from the Micro-USB connector
    (default) or an external 5V supply at the +5VIN pin.

---
#### **Breaking Target Section Apart**

  You may wish to break the target section apart from the main capture
  board. This can easily be accomplished by following these instructions:

1.  Using a sharp knife (such as Xacto knife or retractable safety knife), cut the traces on the bottom side of the board along the cut line. Pass the knife back and forth several times. Scoring the board deeply will make the breaking process easier and less stressful on the PCB:

![image](Images/breakstep1.png "image")

2.  Score the board on the top side:

![image](Images/breakstep2.png "image")

3.  Select a surface to break the board over. It is suggested to have a piece of cardboard or boxboard down to protect components on the bottom side of the ChipWhisperer:

![image](Images/breakstep3.png "image")

4.  Hold the main board section flat, apply even pressure to the target board section. It should snap downward:

![image](Images/breakstep4.png "image")

5.  Separate the two sections:

![image](Images/breakstep5.png "image")

You can see a video of the process here:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8sIrvG5jqiQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Applying even pressure will help prevent damage to the
ChipWhisperer-Lite main section. Flexing the PCB too much may cause
damage to solder joints, but by holding the entire board flat against
the edge this is prevented.

(vtarget-usage)=
#### **VTarget Usage**

**NOTE: The recommended method of interfacing with non 3.3V devices is to use external level shifters (like our [CW506](../Tools/CW506%20Advanced%20Breakout%20Board.md)). Use this method at your own risk!**

By default, Pin 8 of the 20-pin connector is unconnected on the ChipWhisperer-Lite. This pin can instead be connected
to the Lite's FPGA VCCO_N pins, which controls the FPGA's IO voltage, by desoldering pin SJ6 and connecting JP5 pins 2 and 3.

Note that this only controls the IO voltage for the FPGA, not other chips on the board. 
Users are responsible for ensuring the voltage fed into this pin does not cause issues with other chips on the board.
Feeding in incorrect voltages may damage the FPGA or other chips on the ChipWhisperer-Lite. Use this feature at your
own risk.

### **Upgrading SAM3U Firmware**

When talking about the ChipWhisperer's firmware, there is really two
parts to this:

1.  The FPGA Bitstream file.
2.  The SAM3U USB interface chip firmware.

The FPGA bitstream alone is what is normally configured by the
ChipWhisperer-Capture software. This bitstream is always the most
up-to-date, since it's automatically reloaded by the computer every time
you power cycle the ChipWhisperer-Capture. The SAM3U firmware is
not updated automatically, but it tends to change less frequently.

To learn how to check your SAM3U firmware version and how to upgrade, go to {doc}`../firmware`.

---

(erase-pins)=
#### **Erase Pins**

If you are unable to connect to the ChipWhisperer-Lite to erase its firmware, the SAM3U firmware
can also be erased by shorting JP2 while the Lite is on. With the USB connector
above, JP2 is located below the SAM3U, directly above the
20-pin connector on the bottom left of the board and has the text `ERASE` below
it.

After shorting the pins, unplug and replug the USB connector and you should
see D2 and D9 lit dimly, indicating that the firmware has been erased.

See {doc}`../firmware` for more information on erasing and re-programming ChipWhisperer-Lite firmware.

![eraseexample](Images/lite-erase-jumper.jpg)

---
#### **Generating Partial Reconfig Files**

The Lite uses partial reconfiguration of its FPGA bitfile to adjust the phase offset for glitch width/offset.

If you're doing a custom FPGA bitfile and want to generate these files (in order to retain glitch width/offset setting capabilities), it can be done as follows:

* Get the .bit file built (from directory hardware/capture/chipwhisperer-lite/hdl, you'd run the commands in makeprojects_win.bat, then open the project in ISE & build the bitstream)
* Run the script generate_reconfig_dicts.py in that same directory. This script takes a LONG time to run, as it generates bitstreams for each option.
* Afterwards you'll get two files - cwlite-glitchoffset.p & cwlite-glitchwidth.p . You must copy these two files + the file cwlite_interface.bit that you built in step 1 into a zip-file, called cwlite_firmware.zip.
* Make a backup of `chipwhisperer/hardware/capture/chipwhisperer-lite/cwlite_firmware.zip` and `chipwhisperer/software/chipwhisperer/hardware/firmware/`
* Replace `chipwhisperer/hardware/capture/chipwhisperer-lite/cwlite_firmware.zip` with this new file.
* Open `chipwhisperer/software/chipwhisperer/hardware/firmware/generate_firmware_files.py` and, within `file_list`, comment out every entry except the one containing `cwlite.py`. After this, run `generate_firmware_files.py`.

## Errata

### VCC Transistors Get Stuck on During Glitching

When voltage glitching, the glitch transistor in use can get stuck on. This keeps the
target's VCC rail pulled low until the transistor is deactivated via `scope.io.glitch_lp` or `scope.io.glitch_hp`.

#### Workaround

Toggle `scope.io.glitch_lp`/`scope.io.glitch_hp` after each glitch attempt. `scope.io.vglitch_reset()` can be called
to do this.

### offset_fine and width_fine are write-only

`scope.glitch.offset_fine` and `scope.glitch.width_fine` are write-only and reads will always return 0.

#### Workaround

Store values written to these properties separately.
