# 20-Pin Connector

All ChipWhisperer capture hardware and most ChipWhisperer targets use a
standard 20-pin connector for connecting capture devices to targets. This
connector carries power and I/O pins between the ChipWhisperer capture
device and the target board. 

There are some minor variations on pin functions depending on the hardware;
these are noted below.


## Pinout
```{tip}
Each ChipWhisperer capture hardware unit comes with a handy sticker to make
locating these pins easier.

## Pin Descriptions

```{note}
Note: directions are relative to the **capture** device. \
I: input to ChipWhisperer capture device / output from target \
O: output from ChipWhisperer capture device / input to target
