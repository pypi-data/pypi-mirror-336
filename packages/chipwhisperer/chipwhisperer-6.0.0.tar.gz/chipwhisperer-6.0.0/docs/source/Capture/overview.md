# Overview and Comparison

ChipWhisperer is a platform that makes researching and testing embedded side channel attacks simple, easy, replicable, and convenient. In particular, ChipWhisperer focuses on power analysis and voltage/clock glitching.

This page compares the features of five capture side hardware devices: the ChipWhisperer-Husky, the ChipWhisperer-Husky-Plus, the CW1200 ChipWhisperer-Pro (CWPro), the CW1173 ChipWhisperer-Lite (CWLite), and the CW1101 ChipWhisperer-Nano (CWNano). As a quick overview

* All are capable of power analysis and glitching
    * The ChipWhisperer Nano cannot clock glitch, but can voltage glitch
* The ChipWhisperer Nano is the lowest cost option, but has many limitations compared to the Husky, Lite and Pro. These limit what attacks can be performed using it, especially against non-NewAE targets.
* The ChipWhisperer-Lite and ChipWhisperer-Pro share the same basic specifications, but the Pro has additional features
    * These additional features, such as IO and Analog triggering, are especially useful when researching attacks against non-NewAE targets, such as development boards. It also has SMA connectors for trigger input and output, allowing for easy interfacing with lab equipment.
* All capture devices can perform power analysis synchronous to the target's clock
    * This helps attacks succeed at much lower sampling frequencies than a conventional oscilloscope
* The Husky has better analog capabilities than the Lite or Pro, allowing attacks on more targets, as well
as ones running at higher frequencies
* The Husky's glitch resolution is independent of the target clock, allowing for more accurate and
reliable glitches

On this page, "Husky" refers to both the "regular" Husky and to Husky Plus.
All differences between Husky and Husky Plus are summarized
