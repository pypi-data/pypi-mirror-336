# Capture
`Capture` contains information about the "capture" side of the ChipWhisperer hardware. These
devices -- ChipWhisperer-Nano, -Lite, -Pro, and -Husky -- are the part of the hardware
actually performing the side-channel attacks. For example, they can measure power consumption, allowing
you to recover an encryption key, or insert voltage glitches to cause mayhem on an embedded device.

Not sure about the differences between capture hardware? We've got some handy [comparison tables](overview.md).
