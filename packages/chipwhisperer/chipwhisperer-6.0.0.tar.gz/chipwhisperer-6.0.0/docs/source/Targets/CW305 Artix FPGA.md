# CW305 Artix FPGA Target

The CW305 is a standalone FPGA target board. It features 
a USB interface to talking to the FPGA, an external PLL for
clocking the FPGA, a programming VCC-INT supply, and
diode protection for use in fault injection environments.
The CW305 board is available in a number of configurations

Like with other ChipWhisperer standalone targets, it requires
an external device for side channel power analysis or fault injection
and features the standard ChipWhisperer 20-pin/SMA interface.

## Basic Hardware Overview

### USB Interface

The USB interface for the CW305 implements the higher lever
simpleserial commands, such as 
{py:meth}`simpleserial_read() <chipwhisperer.targets.SimpleSerial.simpleserial_read>`
and
{py:meth}`simpleserial_write() <chipwhisperer.targets.SimpleSerial.simpleserial_write>`

For lower level communication, the CW305 allows you to directly
read and write to registers and does not feature the serial `read()`/`write()`
like with the {ref}`SimpleSerial <api-target-simpleserial>` class. For full documentation, see
{ref}`the CW305 target API documentation <api-target-cw305>`


To reduce noise in your power measurements, you may want to disable the USB clock
while the encryption operation is happening. Again, this can be done via the Python
API.

---

### PLL

The CW305 implements a CDCE906 PLL for clocking the FPGA, which can be programmed over USB to output
frequencies from roughly 5MHz, to 160MHz. It is capable of outputting 3 channels,
with two routed to the FPGA and 1 routed to an output SMA connector. The reference
design uses PLL output 1 for the FPGA clock. As the following diagram shows,
it has a very flexible architecture: 

![CDCE906 PLL Architecture, with CW305
Connections Marked](Images/Cw305_pll.png
"CDCE906 PLL Architecture, with CW305 Connections Marked")

PLL1 and PLL2 connect to FPGA pins N13 and E12, respectively. The SMA connector X6 can be
connected to any of the PLLs, allowing you to get a phase-matched clock on X6 that corresponds
perfectly to the clock being fed to the FPGA. 

---

### Power Supply

The CW305 board contains three switching regulators. Two are fixed and
route to VCC-AUX (1.8V) and VCC-IO (3.3V), while the remaining one can be programmed over USB to output between 0.65V and 1.5V. This is limited in software
to a range of 0.8V-1.10V to prevent damage to the FPGA. The VCC-INT regulator is capable of supplying 6A to the FPGA.

Power can be supplied to the CW305 via either the USB-B
connector, or via a 5V DC Jack. If you use a large
FPGA design, you may exceed the 500mA USB current limit,
in which case you must use the DC Jack to supply the board instead.
It is suggested that you use a supply that is capable of supplying
at least 2A.

![psw\_1.jpg](Images/psw_1.jpg "psw_1.jpg")

An onboard 3x7 segment display provides an easy visual voltage
measurement of VCC-INT so you can confirm settings without needing to attach
a multimeter.

The following image shows details of how the power supplies are routed on
the CW305 board:

![cw305\_vccrouting.png](Images/cw305_vccrouting.png "cw305_vccrouting.png")

---

### Shunt Measurement

A resistive shunt is located between the VCC-INT supply and the 
FPGA. SMA connectors provide measurement access to both
the high (X2) and low (X3) sides of the shunt, as well as a 20dB
low noise amplified low side signal (X4). The shunt resistor
can also be measured across via two 0.1" differential
probe headers, one (JP7) directly next to the shunt resistor
and one (JP6) on the top right of the PCB. JP6 is designed
to be used with the [CW501 Differential Probe](../Tools/CW501%20Differential%20Probe.md)

The shunt resistor can be bypassed by shorting JP7.

The following image shows the area on the PCB around
the shunt resistor: 

![shunt.jpg](Images/shunt.jpg "shunt.jpg")

Schematically, this is shown below. NOTE: the schematic flows in the
"opposite" direction of the PCB. In the PCB power flows left to right,
in the schematic it flows right to left.

![cw305\_vccint\_shunt\_sch.png](Images/cw305_vccint_shunt_sch.png
"cw305_vccint_shunt_sch.png")

In addition, two test points are provided on each side that are suitable
for use with an oscilloscope probe. It is **strongly** recommended to
use a SMA to BNC cable (such as Cinch Connectivity P/N 415-0028-024
available from Digikey) to view the power measurement instead of these
test points, as the SNR of the oscilloscope probe will typically be
considerably worse than via the SMA connector.

Depending on your use case, you may want to experiment with
different values of shunt resistor. For example, the default
shunt resistor may cause too much voltage drop for larger designs.
Examples of shunt resistors can be seen in the table below:

| Value | Manufacturer | Part Number |
|------|---------------|------------|
| 500mΩ | Stackpole  | CSR1206FKR500 |
| 250mΩ | Stackpole | CSR2016FKR250 |
| 100mΩ | Samsung | RUW3216FR100CS | 
| 50mΩ | Vishay | WSLP1206R0500FEA |

---

### Fault Injection

The CW305 is designed to facilitate all forms of fault injection.
Resistive and diode protection prevents transients on the VCC-IO of the
FPGA from affecting the USB interface chip. The USB chip itself provides
high-speed FPGA reconfiguration to simplify repetitive fault attacks
where you need to reconfigure the FPGA. The USB interface can also
monitor the INITB pin of the FPGA, which can be used with the continuous
CRC verification feature to determine when reconfiguration is required.

Crowbar faults can be injected on the low side of the shunt resistor
using SMA connector X3. The PCB also features mounting holes and
alignment features for use with an X-Y table (suitable for
both EM fault injection and an H-Field probe).

Note that the VCC-INT banana plugs are not suitable voltage glitching
points as filtering is present after them.

If using an external fault amplifier, connect again to X3, and remove the jumper
next to the shunt resistor as described in the [the jumper section](#jumper).

---

### Programming the FPGA

The FPGA can be programmed either by 
{ref}`ChipWhisperer software <api-target-cw305>` 
over the USB interface, or by Xilinx Vivado over the JTAG interface
(this requires an external programmer such as the 
[Xilinx platform cable](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/hw-usb-ii-g.html)).

If you wish to ILAs to debug your FPGA design, then you must use the JTAG
programming method.

With both of these methods, the FPGA must be programmed every time the
device is power cycled.

There is also an on-board SPI flash chip which can be used to store a bitstream. See more details of
the SPI chip programming below.

These different modes are selected using S1 on the back of the board:

![mode\_switches.jpg](Images/mode_switches.jpg "mode_switches.jpg")

The setting of the mode switches must be set as in the following table
for the desired configuration mode:

| M0 | M1 | M2 | Configuration Mode |
| -- | -- | -- | ------------------ |
| 1  | 0  | 0  | SPI Flash          |
| 1  | 0  | 1  | JTAG               |
| 1  | 1  | 1  | USB (Default)      |

To learn how to program a specific bitfile (i.e. generated by you), head
over to the {ref}`CW305 target API page <api-target-cw305>`.

## Advanced Hardware Overview

### Power Supply/Measurement

#### Powering VCC-INT with an External Supply

You may want to use your fancy, super low noise
external power supply instead of the onboard
switching power supply for VCC-INT. This can be
done by feeding power into the two banana
jacks on the board. **Be very careful to ensure you do not exceed 1.10V
on this input, as feeding in too high of a voltage can damage the FPGA.**

![psw\_2.jpg](Images/psw_2.jpg "psw_2.jpg")

The choice of internal/external supply is selected with a switch located
right beside the positive banana jack input. There are large capacitors
and a ferrite bead on this input, so it is not suitable for inserting voltage
glitches.

---

#### VCC-INT Decoupling Capacitors

Optional decoupling capacitors can be mounted on the low side of the VCC-INT shunt. They are located
on the bottom of the board and are typically not mounted when using the shunt resistor
to measure power waveforms.

The optional decoupling capacitors for the VCC-INT rail are shown on the
underside of the PCB here:

![vccint\_caps.jpg](Images/vccint_caps.jpg "vccint_caps.jpg")

---

#### VCC-AUX Shunt Resistor

The VCC-INT shunt is the primary power measurement point,
as it provides power measurement for both designs inside the FPGA, as 
well as the logic for decrypting bitstreams (as reported at https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/249.pdf).

There may be additional information in the VCC-AUX power supply, such as
JTAG state transitions. There is a secondary
shunt position (by default with no shunt mounted) for exploration of the
VCC-AUX power supply. This can be seen in the schematic here:

![cw305\_vccaux\_shunt\_sch.png](Images/cw305_vccaux_shunt_sch.png
"cw305_vccaux_shunt_sch.png")

The shunt is located on the rear side of the PCB, as shown here:

![P1080944.jpg](Images/P1080944.jpg "P1080944.jpg")

If using this shunt, you must **remove** resistor R26 (which has a metal
slug 0-ohm resistor mounted) and replace with an appropriately sized
0805 resistor (suggested: 1 ohm). You must also remove capacitor C98,
C95, C97, C94, and C93. They can be seen in the above photo.

---

#### Low Noise Power Supply

Optional low-noise linear power supplies are available, which fit into the connectors around the switch-mode power supply. They have less power handling capabilities than the on-board switch-mode supplies, but have reduced noise that ends up injected into the PCB (and thus on the power traces).

These power supplies are only used for VCC-IO and VCC-AUX. Like the on-board supplies they will be disabled when the power to the FPGA is switched off using 
the target power switch.

If you wish to have the lowest-noise power source, you must mount the VCC-IO and VCC-AUX low-noise supplies, and also use an external supply for the VCC-INT supply.

---

(jumper)=
#### Jumper

In some circumstances you may wish to entirely remove the shunt
resistor. This is typically the case when performing fault insertion,
where the large "filter" capacitors present on the high side of the
shunt resistor will drastically reduce the slew rate of your fault
amplifier.

Alternatively, you may wish to use a current transformer or similar
current probe which requires a method of inserting a sensor into the
VCC-INT path.

For these uses test point TP2 and TP3 have gold-plated "nails" soldered
into them, and a wire bridge soldered between the test points. This wire
bridge can be removed by either cutting (with wire cutters) or
desoldering. The gold-plated nails provide a mechanically strong base
which allows you to perform this operation without risking damage to the
CW305 PCB.

If using a current probe, you can either (1) solder a wire between TP2
and TP3, or (2) use two SMA connectors to route the power between X2 and
X3. Clamp your current probe onto the bare wire used to route the signal
between these (you'll need a custom cable without the shield most
likely).

The gold-plated nails that require soldering are used instead of a
switch or jumper to reduce the resistance in the measurement path.
Typical switches provide too high of a contact resistance for the
potential current draw of a large design in the FPGA, which would reduce
the SNR at the measurement point.

---

#### Power Cycling the Board

The CW305 can be power cycled via SW5:

![fpga\_autoonoff.jpg](Images/fpga_autoonoff.jpg "fpga_autoonoff.jpg")

When in the "OFF" mode the VCC-INT, VCC-IO, and VCC-AUX supplies are
turned off. In addition the communications interfaces are all disabled
to avoid back-powering the FPGA via the IO pins. If you have external
connections (such as driving a clock from the ChipWhisperer) you need to
ensure they are also disabled when the power is turned off.

---

### I/O and LEDs

#### GPIO Header

A 40-pin header is mounted at JP3. This female header also comes with a dual-sided male 40-pin header which ships which each PCB, allowing you to use either gender of connectors with this header.

The pinout of the header is marked on the PCB. All pins are routed to 3.3V VCC-IO banks on the Artix 7 FPGA. The layout of the header is such that the following can directly be plugged into the board:

* Digilent Inc PMOD Devices
* NewAE OpenADC Module

---

#### ChipWhisperer 20-Pin Connector

The bottom right side of the PCB contains a 20-pin connector that follows the standard ChipWhisperer pinout. This connector has ESD diodes present on the PCB to protect both the FPGA from external transients, and from glitches inserted into the FPGA from exiting the board and damaging external test gear.

The 20-pin connector is documented [here](../Capture/20-pin-connector.md).

---

#### Clock SMA Connectors

Three additional SMA connectors are provided that output
directly from a PLL channel (X6), allow you to feed a 
clock input into the FPGA (X7), or output
a clock signal from the FPGA (X8).

---

#### Switches

Two user switches are provided: one push-button and one 4-item DIP
switch.

The push-button (SW4) routes to FPGA pin R1.

The dip-switch (S2) routes to FPGA pins J16, K16, K15, and L14. With the reference FPGA design, the
dip switch has the following uses:

| J16         | Input Clock Source  |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| 1           | ChipWhisperer HS-IO |
| 0 (Default) | PLL1                |

| K16         | ChipWhisperer HS-Out |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| 1 (Default) | Enabled (clock)      |
| 0           | Disabled             |

See the example design documentation for more details.

---

### Using the On-Board SPI Memory

The on-board SPI memory chip can be used for your own program storage (when implementing soft-core processors), or can be used for a FPGA configuration bitstream if
the mode switches are set as above.

Details of SPI FLASH memory & FPGA usage is seen in [XAPP586](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/application_notes/xapp586-spi-flash.pdf)

#### Part Numbers

Three part numbers have been used during the production runs (as devices go EOL the part numbers change typically):

| Part Number      | Vivado | ISE Impact | Dates       | Notes                                    |
| -----------------| -------| ---------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| S25FL132K0XMFI04 |  ?     | Yes        | Before 2018 | Part is Obsolete                         |
| AT25SF321        | No     | ?          | 2018 - 2021 | May have used AT25SF321A. Both parts now EOL.  |
| MX25L3233FMI1-08 | Yes    | ?          | 2021 -      | Boards produced late 2021 onward. Tested in Vivado.   |

Some of the SPI chips are not directly supported as a programmable chip from the Xilinx design tools, meaning you cannot use the "Attached Serial Flash" option
for those parts from ISE or Vivado. You can use the built-in USB programmer instead for those flash chips, as described next.

Note that ISE Impact supported using a `XIL_IMPACT_SKIPIDCODECHECK=1` environment variable, which caused Impact to work with any compatible memory even if the
IDCode was not exactly the same. ISE Impact supports only the Artix A100, it does not support the Artix A35 FPGA. Thus even if you install ISE 14.7 (no longer trivial), it may not support your CW305 board.

Vivado does not support this override option, and requires the IDCode to match exactly. Note that if Vivado finds an attached SPI flash memory with an
IDCode that does not exactly match the expected one, it will report the IDCode as being `0, 0, 0` (even if the IDCode was correctly read as non-zero). Due to
the difficulty in debugging this, we typically recommend using the USB programming described next instead.

#### Programming over USB 

Recently, the ChipWhisperer software integrated support for programming the SPI flash directly. This requires you to load a small "shim" bitstream into the FPGA,
which connects the SPI flash pins to the SAM3U.

This means during SPI programming your FPGA design will be cleared. You can reload your FPGA design of course afterwards, but if you are using a soft-core type system
you should program the SPI flash first, then load your FPGA bitstream (which will clear out the SPI-flash bitstream).

SPI API documentation for this can be found on the {ref}`target API documentation page <cw305-spi-program>`.

Note you'll need to adjust the mode switches back and forth for this to work - the switches need to be set to allow USB programming for the shim to work, then can be switched back to load from the on-board SPI flash.

#### Generating SPI Flash files from Vivado

To generate the `.mcs` or `.bin` files inside of Vivado, use the `write_cfgmem` command. You'll need to change directory first for this to work. An example run is shown below:

```
cd C:/dev/chipwhisperer/firmware/fpgas/aes/vivado/cw305_aes.runs/impl_35t
write_cfgmem -format mcs -interface SPIx1 -size 32 -loadbit "up 0x0 cw305_top.bit" -file cw305_a35_aes.mcs
write_cfgmem -format bin -interface SPIx1 -size 32 -loadbit "up 0x0 cw305_top.bit" -file cw305_a35_aes.bin
```

The `.mcs` file can be used by Vivado, and the `.bin` can be used by Vivado or the ChipWhisperer programming tool described above.

When using the SPI on-board chip to boot me sure you adjusted the mode switches. You can toggle the FPGA power with switch SW5 to force it to reload after changing the mode switches, or toggle the `PGM` pin via software.

## SAM3U Firmware

Like with other ChipWhisperer hardware
with a USB interface, the onboard SAM3U microcontroller
providing the interface can be reprogrammed. The bootloader can be entered and new firmware can be uploaded using the same
interface as the ChipWhisperer Capture hardware:
{doc}`../firmware`.

There is also a Cortex Debug Connector located near the USB-B connector that 
can be used to program and debug the SAM3U.

The firmware for the SAM3U is open-source and can be modified as you wish; find it in the [cw305-artix-target repository](https://github.com/newaetech/cw305-artix-target)

Currently, you build it with:

```
cd fw/sam3u/CW305_SAM3U_FW/src
make clean
make
```
