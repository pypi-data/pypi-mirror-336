# Targets

ChipWhisperer's various targets take the difficulty out of setting up hardware for side channel attacks!
In addition to interfacing with ChipWhisperer's [20-pin connector](../Capture/20-pin-connector.md) and SMA-connectors, these target boards
already have necessary side channel modifications (shunt resistor, capacitor removal, etc.) integrated
into the board, so there's no need to reach for your soldering iron or utility knife!

## Integrated Targets

The following targets typically come attached to a capture board:

| Target | Device | Architecture | Hardware Crypto |Programmer | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------------|-----------------|-----------|---------|------|
| CW303 XMEGA | ATXmega128D4-AU | 8-bit Harvard  | No| CW-integrated  | Released | |
| CW303 Arm | STM32F303RCT6 |Arm Cortex-M4 | No | CW-integrated  | Released |
| CW1101 Target Board | STM32F030F4P6 | Arm Cortex-M0 | No | CW-integrated  | Released | 

These boards are integrated into a capture board and therefore can be found
with the associated capture design files: [https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer-capture](https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer-capture)

## Standalone Targets

The following targets don't come attached to a target and must be connected to a capture board
with a 20-pin cable and SMA cables

| Target | Device | Architecture | Hardware Crypto |Programmer | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------------|-----------------|-----------|---------|------|
| CW304 Notduino | ATMega328P | 8-bit Harvard  | No | CW-integrated  | Released | Only available as PCB + components (unsoldered) |
| CW305 Artix FPGA | Xilinx Artix-7 | FPGA | Yes | CW-integrated , external | Released |
| CW310 Kintex FPGA | Xilinx Kintex-7 | FPGA | Yes | CW-integrated, external | Released |

### CW308 Targets

The CW308 UFO board is a convenient main board for attacking a wide variety of targets. It includes
many niceties for running target boards off of, including various voltage regulators, a crystal drive
circuit, clock selection, and programming headers for standards like JTAG.

Hardware design files for targets can be found on our Github at: [https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer-target-cw308t](https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer-target-cw308t)

Many targets are available for the CW308:

HAL, but we did not have sufficient interest to perform the production run.
