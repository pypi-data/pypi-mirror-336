# CW308 UFO

The CW308 UFO Board is a convenient main-board for attacking all sorts
of embedded targets. Released in 2016, it forms the basis for most of
our upcoming target boards. It can be used stand-alone (with an
oscilloscope) or with ChipWhisperer-Capture hardware.

## Specifications

Varies by target board. See `UFO Targets` for target documentation

Available in the [Level 1 Starter Kit](../Starter%20Kits/SCAPACK-L1.md), the [Level 2 Starter Kit](../Starter%20Kits/SCAPACK-L2.md), and the [ChipWhisperer-Pro Starter Kit](../Starter%20Kits/SCAPACK-L2.md).

Also available standalone with a [CW308T-STM32F3](../chipwhisperer-target-cw308t/CW308T_STM32F/README.md) target and
a [CW308T-XMEGA](../chipwhisperer-target-cw308t/CW308T_XMEGA/README.md) target from the [NewAE Store](https://store.newae.com/cw308-ufo-board/)

## Supported Targets

The CW308 UFO board supports a wide variety of targets. See the `UFO Targets` subdirectory for more information. 
Some targets are
available premade, but all have gerber files in the GIT repo so you can
build them yourself.

Examples of targets available as CW308 target boards:

  - [CW308T-GENERIC](../chipwhisperer-target-cw308t/CW308T_GENERIC/README.md "wikilink") (Protoboard)

    802.15.4 radio, 32-bit ARM Cortex M0)
  - [CW308T-MEGARF](../chipwhisperer-target-cw308t/CW308T_ATMega1284RFR2/README.md "wikilink") (Atmel MegaRF2564RFR2,
    8-bit AVR)
  - [CW308T-MSP430FR5](../chipwhisperer-target-cw308t/CW308T_MSP430/README.md "wikilink") (TI MSP430FR5xxx,
    16-bit)
  - [CW308T-S6LX9](../chipwhisperer-target-cw308t/CW308T_S6LX9/README.md "wikilink") (Xilinx Spartan 6 LX9 in
    TQFP, FPGA)

If you need to support a new target, it's generally very simple to build
a custom board.

## Victim Board Connectors

The "victim board" fits into three 20-pin female headers. They provide
both electrical and mechanical connections for the board. There is
optional mounting holes which can be used if additional mechanical
support is required (especially if you need a locked-down victim for use
with an EM probe).

The following shows the dimensions of the main connector:

Note the middle mounting hole is slightly offset to one direction\! This
was done to keep the mounting hole on a 100-mil grid spacing.

### Removing / Replacing Victim Boards

The target board is removed and replaced using the removal tool. This
helps avoid bending pins:

![Images/P1090067.jpg](Images/P1090067.jpg "P1090067.jpg")

The following shows the removal process:

![Images/removal.gif](Images/Removal.gif "removal.gif")

Adding a board involves carefully aligning the board and pushing down:

![Images/addition.gif](Images/Addition.gif "addition.gif")

The alignment should be carefully checked if resistance is found. You
may need to adjust how the board is aligned, as you should be able to
press down with minimal force.

The CW308 should be turned off when swapping victim boards.

## I/O Connections

There are two main I/O connection points: the pin headers which
duplicate the target board connections, and the 20-pin ChipWhisperer
header.

The ChipWhisperer header pins (most of the pins on header J5) have diode
protection to set a maximum voltage level. The maximum voltage is set by
the voltage present on the middle pin of J4.

### VREF Level Setting

The on-board 'VREF' network sets the reference voltage to allow usage
with multiple I/O levels. Note there are no voltage translators
on-board, instead you can use the \[CW506 Advanced Breakout Board\] to
provide voltage translation. One of the pins on the 20-pin connector
outputs the reference voltage (VREF), so the CW506 knows what voltage
level to translate I/O signals to.

The on-board crystal oscillator is powered from the VREF network,
ensuring the on-board oscillator is at an appropriate voltage reference.

The I/O pins connected to the 20-pin header have diode clamping, with
the maximum level set by the VREF network. You must ensure jumper J4
sets a correct reference level. If using any of the official victim
boards this is done by setting J4 to receive it's reference level from
"J5-VREF" pin.

### 20-Pin Connector

The 20-pin connector (J1) is documented [here](../Capture/20-pin-connector.md).

## Clock Network

### Crystal Driver

The CW308 contains a crystal oscillator driver. This allows you to use a
standard crystal to drive either the victim board or the connected
ChipWhisperer. This also allows the use of the CW308 stand-alone, as
it's possible to generate almost any frequency by simply putting an
appropriate crystal into the socket.

![P1090074.jpg](Images/P1090074.jpg "P1090074.jpg")

### Clock Selection

The clock routing is selected using jumper J3. This allows the following
use cases:

  - Routing crystal oscillator (X1) to victim CLKIN.
  - Routing crystal oscillator (X1) to ChipWhisperer HS-IN, then routing
    HS-OUT to victim CLKIN (for glitch insertion).
  - Routing CLKFB from victim to ChipWhisperer HS-IN.
  - Routing ChipWhisperer HS-OUT to victim CLKIN.

## Power Distribution

The following shows the routing of power to the victim board:

![cw308\_switch.png](Images/Cw308_switch.png "cw308_switch.png")

The following summarizes the switch information:

| Switch | Function                                       | Location   | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| S1     | Switch 5.0V from DC-Power Jack On/Off          | Lower Left | Selects if DC 5.0V from DC-Jack is "always on", or gets gated by 3.3V source from 20-pin connector ('auto').

| S3-S7  | Selected fixed LDO input source.               |            | Can be used to turn on/off certain LDOs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| S8     | Select adjustable LDO input source.            |            | Select 5.0V or 3.3V input (3.3V comes from ChipWhisperer).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| S2     | Choose 3.3V source to connect to victim board. |            | Select 3.3V from 20-pin ChipWhisperer cable, or local LDO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

### External Power Sources

There are two main sources to supply power to the CW308:

  - DC-input power jack (2.1mm barrel jack, center positive, 5.0V)
  - ChipWhisperer 20-pin connector (5.0V and 3.3V).

Note you can use the DC-input power jack alongside the ChipWhisperer
power supply. The CW308 can switch the DC-power on/off, allowing the
ChipWhisperer to still control the target power.

If using the board stand-alone, you can use the 3.3V pin of the CW20 pin
to turn on/off the board remotely. This pin can be used as a digital
input, which will turn on/off the 5.0V power jack. Be sure to switch all
regulators to use the 5.0V DC-Jack in this case to avoid having a load
on the 3.3V pin.

### On-Board LDOs

There are five LDOs on-board the CW308. While they are mostly rated for
800mA, the board does not have sufficient thermal dissipation to operate
at these conditions.

Four of the LDOs have fixed voltage settings: 1.2V, 1.8V, 2.5V, and
3.3V. The fifth LDO is adjustable, and is especially useful if you need
to either (a) overcome the voltage drop of a shunt, or (b) feed a power
supply into a device to turn off an internal regulator.

### Adjustable Voltage Example

## Power Filter

The CW308 contains a L-C low-pass filter. This filter is designed to
provide a highly filtered version of the power supply to the victim
board. The various voltages on the victim board power headers can be
directly routed to the various required power pins. For example if your
device has an on-board PLL, this power supply is something we do not
need to measure as part of the power analysis.

The "core" voltage supply for the device should first be fed through the
on-board filter. This is accomplished by feeding the desired voltage
(for example a 1.8V supply) into the "FILT" pin (pin C8). The output of
the filter will be present on the FILT\_LP and FILT\_HP pins. You can
then feed this through your shunt resistor, and finally to the core
voltage of the device being measured.

Note jumper J14 can be used to override the filter input voltage. This
override can come from the adjustable regulator as previously mentioned.

## Programmer Connections

There are several headers that can be used as programming headers for
the victim board. These are J10, J12, an J15. They are routed to pins 10
to 20 (H1 to H10) on the victim board connector J9. These connectors
function is defined by the specific victim board mounted.

![cw308\_programming.png](Images/Cw308_programming.png "cw308_programming.png")

In addition there is a 20-pin JTAG header. This uses the standard JTAG
ARM pinout.

## Jumper Summary

ChipWhisperer 20-pin connector VREF pin, selects I/O level for crystal
oscillator.

## Usage Example: Stand-Alone

The CW308 can be used stand-alone. This is accomplished by providing an
external DC power supply, and using a SMA-BNC to connect the voltage
measurement to an oscilloscope. For more details, see TODO (old wiki link:
[](https://wiki.newae.com/CW308T:_Stand-Alone_Simple_Serial_Example_(AVR_or_XMEGA)))

If using a simple-serial target (such as the XMEGA or AVR), you can
connect a USB-Serial device to provide communication.
