# Level 2 Starter Kit (SCAPACK-L2)

This starter pack extends the Level 1 pack by adding the features needed for working with external targets (besides the included UFO targets). The advanced breakout board can perform level-shifting when you aren't working with 3.3V I/O or need additional breakout.

The probe kit allows use of EM probe for measuring power without inserting shunt resistors, and the differential probe simplifies usage of off-board shunts.

Like the Level 1 kit, this is a great tool to get started in power analysis and fault injection attacks.
