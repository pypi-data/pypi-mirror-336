# ChipWhisperer-Lite

The ChipWhisperer-Lite represents NewAE Technology Inc.’s most aggressive pursuit of it’s mission to bring side-channel power analysis and glitching attacks to every engineer and student. The FULLY open-source (hardware, software, 
firmware, FPGA code) is launching a revolution in hardware security. In particular, the ChipWhisperer-Lite
serves as a good middle ground between the full feature-set of the ChipWhisperer-Pro, and the affordability of
the ChipWhisperer-Nano.

## Hardware

The ChipWhisperer-Lite, as the name suggests, features the [ChipWhisperer-Lite capture hardware](../Capture/ChipWhisperer-Lite.md). Its datasheet can be found on Mouser: https://www.mouser.ca/datasheet/2/894/NAE-CW1173_datasheet-1859842.pdf

The ChipWhisperer-Lite has a few available hardware options:

| ChipWhisperer-Lite Standalone | None | No | micro-usb cable, 20-pin cable, SMA cables | [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/NewAE/NAE-CWLITE-CAPTURE?qs=r5DSvlrkXmKUDG90PYjKIA%3D%3D) |

## Turning a 1-Part into a 2-Part

Want to attack other targets with your 1-part board? Simply break the 
target portion of the board off as described on the ChipWhisperer-Lite capture page, 
solder a 20-pin connector on your capture board, and solder SMA connectors onto the
capture board's
