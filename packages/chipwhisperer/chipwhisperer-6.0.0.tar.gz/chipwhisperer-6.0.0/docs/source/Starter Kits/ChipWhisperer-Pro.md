# CW1200 ChipWhisperer-Pro Level 3 Starter Kit

The CW1200 (ChipWhisperer Pro) is an upgraded version of the
ChipWhisperer Lite capture hardware. The Pro includes an FPGA with much
more space than the Lite, allowing many new features to be added,
including a larger sample buffer, streaming-mode captures, additional
trigger methods, and a touchscreen interface. These features make it a
high-end device suitable for laboratory use.

## Hardware

In addition to the ChipWhisperer-Pro, the ChipWhisperer-Pro Starter Kit also comes with
multiple targets (a CW308T-XMEGA and a CW308T-STM32F3), as well as additional
NewAE tools to improve your ability to attack non-NewAE targets.
