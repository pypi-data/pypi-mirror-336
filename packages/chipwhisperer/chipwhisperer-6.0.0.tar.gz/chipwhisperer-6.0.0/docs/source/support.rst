Running into trouble? Have a question you can't find the answer for?
First, be sure to go through our `Jupyter notebooks <https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer-jupyter>`__.
They are how we teach how to use ChipWhisperer.
If you've done that and *still* don't have an answer, there's a few places
you can get help:

* :doc:`Tips and Tricks <cw_tips_tricks/intro>`
    This is where we've gathered answers to the most commonly asked
    questions. Check this out first! Most of the questions that we get have
    been asked already, and if it's a common question, then you'll
    definitely find the answer here.

* `NewAE Forum`_:
    The forum for all things related to side-channel analysis. If you are
    stuck and need help, *and* your question is not answered in our 
    :doc:`Tips and Tricks <cw_tips_tricks/intro>` section, then go here next
    to ask for help. Whether about ChipWhisperer hardware or with other
    projects related to side-channel analysis, all discussion is welcome.
    One of us at NewAE Technology usually monitors the forum and there is a
    good chance we can help you. There are also other active members that
    are also on the forum which may have run into the same problems you
    have. Before posting please take a look at other forum posts, using its
    search function. You may find your answer quicker than you think.

* `ChipWhisperer Discord`_:
    We also have a Discord server! It is monitored by staff, so you can
    absolutely ask support questions there, but it is also intended for
    general side-channel chit-chat and bouncing of ideas.
