        <h4>Python Software Foundation License Version 2</h4>

        <p>1. This LICENSE AGREEMENT is between the Python Software Foundation ("PSF"), and
            the Individual or Organization ("Licensee") accessing and otherwise using this
            software ("Python") in source or binary form and its associated documentation.</p>

        <p>2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, PSF hereby
            grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide license to reproduce,
            analyze, test, perform and/or display publicly, prepare derivative works,
            distribute, and otherwise use Python alone or in any derivative
            version, provided, however, that PSF's License Agreement and PSF's notice of
            copyright, i.e., "Copyright © 2001-2024 Python Software Foundation; All Rights
            Reserved" are retained in Python alone or in any derivative version
            prepared by Licensee.</p>

        <p>3. In the event Licensee prepares a derivative work that is based on or
            incorporates Python or any part thereof, and wants to make the
            derivative work available to others as provided herein, then Licensee hereby
            agrees to include in any such work a brief summary of the changes made to Python.</p>

        <p>4. PSF is making Python available to Licensee on an "AS IS" basis.
            PSF MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.  BY WAY OF
            EXAMPLE, BUT NOT LIMITATION, PSF MAKES NO AND DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR
            WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THAT THE
            USE OF PYTHON WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.</p>

        <p>5. PSF SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER USERS OF PYTHON
            FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS AS A RESULT OF
            MODIFYING, DISTRIBUTING, OR OTHERWISE USING PYTHON, OR ANY DERIVATIVE
            THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.</p>

        <p>6. This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material breach of
            its terms and conditions.</p>

        <p>7. Nothing in this License Agreement shall be deemed to create any relationship
            of agency, partnership, or joint venture between PSF and Licensee.  This License
            Agreement does not grant permission to use PSF trademarks or trade name in a
            trademark sense to endorse or promote products or services of Licensee, or any
            third party.</p>

        <p>
            8. By copying, installing or otherwise using Python, Licensee agrees
               to be bound by the terms and conditions of this License Agreement.</p>
