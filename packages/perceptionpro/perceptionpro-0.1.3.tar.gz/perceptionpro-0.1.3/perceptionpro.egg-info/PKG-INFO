Description: # PerceptionPro
        
        **PerceptionPro** is a Python package designed for real-time monitoring and alert systems. It provides modular components for head pose estimation, eye tracking, and object detection, all integrated into a cohesive alert system.
        
        ## Features
        * **Head Pose Estimation:** Tracks the orientation of the user's head in real-time, providing insights into the direction of attention.
        
        * **Eye Tracking:** Detects and analyzes eye movements and gaze direction, ensuring effective focus monitoring.
        
        * **Object Detection:** Identifies objects in the environment, supporting compliance and situational awareness.
        
        * **Alert System:** Integrated mechanism to trigger alerts based on configurable thresholds for head pose, eye tracking, and object detection.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip install perceptionpro
        ```
        
        ## Components
        
        **1. Head Pose Estimation:**
        
        * Module: `HeadPoseEstimator`
        
        * Uses facial landmarks to determine the orientation of the user's head (e.g., Left, Right, Up, Down, Center).
        
        **2. Eye Tracking:**
        
        * Module: `EyeTracker`
        
        * Tracks eye movements and gaze direction for applications like focus monitoring and attention analysis.
        
        **3. Object Detection:**
        
        * Module: `ObjectDetector`
        
        * Leverages the YOLO model to identify and count objects such as person, book, and cell phone in real-time.
        
        **4. Alert System:**
        
        * Threshold-based system to monitor head pose, eye tracking, and detected objects, triggering alerts when defined criteria are met.
