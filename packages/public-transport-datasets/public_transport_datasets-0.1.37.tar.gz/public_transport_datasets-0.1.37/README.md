## Adopt a City or a Country !
Can't find your City or Country?  
I will be happy for your contribution!  
Send me a message with details for the feed, or with the city and the transportation provider, and I'll try to add to the datasets!

## Installation

You can install the package via pip:
```
public_transport_datasets
```

## How to use
There is a simple webapp available on Github [bus-and-go](https://github.com/maxmazzeschi/bus-and-go) that uses the datasets, plotting data on a map.
