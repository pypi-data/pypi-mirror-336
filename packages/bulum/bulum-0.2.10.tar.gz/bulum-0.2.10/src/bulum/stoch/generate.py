    """Generates a list of daily values from either a daily, montly, or annual pattern.
    The behaviour depends on what type of pattern is supplied. 
    Annual pattern => annual totals are disaggregated to daily by dividing by 365 or 366 as appropriate.
    Monthly pattern => 
        if 1 value is provided, it is used for every month and disaggregated to daily by dividing by the days in the month;
        if 12 values are provided, each month has its own total and which is disaggregated to daily by dividing by the days in the month.
    Daily pattern => 
        if 1 value is provided, it is used for every day;
        if 7 values are provided, they are taken to represent a week and are repeated accordingly;
        if 366 values are provided, they will be taken to represent days in the calendar year and the last value ignored in non-leap-years.
