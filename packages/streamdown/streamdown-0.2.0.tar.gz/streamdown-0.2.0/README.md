# Streamdown

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/streamdown.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/streamdown)

I needed a streaming Markdown TUI CLI shell parser and honestly all the ones I found lacking. They were broken or janky in some kind of way. So here we go. From the ground up. It's a bad idea but it has to be done.

This will work with [simonw's llm](https://github.com/simonw/llm) unlike with [richify.py](https://github.com/gianlucatruda/richify) which jumps around the page or blocks with an elipses or [glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow) which buffers everything, this streams and does exactly what you want.

## Some Features

#### Provides clean copyable code for long code blocks and short terminals.

#### Does OSC 8 links for modern terminals.

#### Doesn't consume characters like _ and * as style when they are in `blocks like this` because `_they_can_be_varaiables_`

#### Palette is configurable
It's HSV based and accepts the `SD_BASEHSV` environment variable where it is a comma separated HSV in the range: `[0-360, 0-1, 0-1]`

For instance:

    $ SD_BASEHSV=150 sd

Yields a nice navy green.

    $ SD_BASEHSV=240,0.8,0.8 sd

Is this fun neon blue. Choose your own adventure.

## Demo
Do this

    $ ./tester.sh tests/*md | ./sd.py

Certainly room for improvement and I'll probably continue to make them
