# TOTP Generator
Simple Python TOTP code generator that stores TOTP secrets in your keyring.
Install with `pip install totp-generator`

As of version 3 this requires python 3.7+. Version 2.x is tested to run on python 2.7 - 3.8, however this major version
will not receive any updates.

Supported keyrings can be found [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyring#what-is-python-keyring-lib). You can also
specify the [keyring settings](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyring#customize-your-keyring-by-config-file) in a config
file. Run `totp_generator` with the -d flag for the config root path and the current keyring service.

setproctitle is an optional dependency due permission and dependency requirements on some systems. Install with
`pip install totp-generator[proctitle]` to install this dependancy and enable setting the process name. This feature
is useful for some uses with some keyrings such as the OSX Keychain.

The clipboard function under linux does require xclip with x11 or wl-clipboard with wayland. See https://github.com/spyoungtech/pyclip/tree/main/docs#platform-specific-notesissues

Run `totp_generator` with the --help flag for more information.


#### Development
This project uses semantic versioning (major.minor.patch).

Install the test requirements with `pip install ".[test]"
`. Run the tests with pytest (see https://codeberg.org/jjfalling/TOTP-Generator/src/branch/master/.github/workflows/python-tests.yml for command).

To create a new build:
 * Bump the version in pyproject.toml
 * Run `python3 -m pip install --upgrade build twine; python -m build`
 * Run `python3 -m twine upload dist/*`
 * Add a new Github release with the git tag that setup.py created (same as the new version number).
